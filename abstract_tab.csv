0,[Stereotactic body radiotherapy: Passing fad or revolution?],31864665,2020/2/01,"Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a young technology that can deliver a high dose of radiation to the target, utilizing either a single dose or a small number of fractions with a high degree of precision within the body. Various technical solutions co-exist nowadays, with particular features, possibilities and limitations. Health care authorities have currently validated SBRT in a very limited number of locations, but many indications are still under investigation. It is therefore challenging to accurately appreciate the SBRT therapeutic index, its place and its role within the anticancer therapeutic arsenal. The aim of the present review is to provide SBRT definitions, current indications, and summarize the future ways of research. There are three validated indications for SBRT: un-resecable T1-T2 non small cell lung cancer, &lt;3 slow-growing pulmonary metastases secondary to a stabilized primary, and the tumours located close to the medulla. In other situations, the benefit of SBRT is still to be demonstrated. One of the most promising way of research is the ablative treatment of oligo metastatic cancers, with recent studies suggesting a survival benefit. Furthermore, the most recent data suggest that SBRT is safe. Finally, the SBRT combined with immune therapies is promising, since it could theoretically trigger the adaptative anticancer response."
0,Status and innovations in pre-treatment CT imaging for proton therapy,31642709,2020/3/01,"Pre-treatment CT imaging is a topic of growing importance in particle therapy. Improvements in the accuracy of stopping-power prediction are demanded to allow for a dose conformality that is not inferior to state-of-the-art image-guided photon therapy. Although range uncertainty has been kept practically constant over the last decades, recent technological and methodological developments, like the clinical application of dual-energy CT, have been introduced or arise at least on the horizon to improve the accuracy and precision of range prediction. This review gives an overview of the current status, summarizes the innovations in dual-energy CT and its potential impact on the field as well as potential alternative technologies for stopping-power prediction."
0,HDR Prostate Brachytherapy,31727300,2020/1/01,"Brachytherapy has become an essential pillar in all-stages of localized prostate cancer, where dose escalation has been demonstrated to improve outcome. HDR brachytherapy has evolved over the decades to be administered in 1-2 fractions. As either monotherapy or in combination with external beam, it offers many advantages over other treatment alternatives. Precise control over dose delivery allows focal dose escalation while sculpting dose around critical organs to maintain excellent tolerance. The high dose per fraction exploits the low α/β ratio of prostate cancer and triggers transcriptional changes in the tumor genome enhancing radiation sensitivity. We review the development, patient selection and results, and describe in detail the techniques for HDR brachytherapy."
0,Image-Guided Gynecologic Brachytherapy for Cervical Cancer,31727296,2020/1/01,"The incorporation of magnetic resonance imaging in brachytherapy has resulted in an increased use of interstitial catheters in order to create a comprehensive treatment plan that covers the visualized tumor. However, the insertion with passive, image-guidance requires estimating the location of the tumor during the insertion process, rather than visualizing and inserting the catheters directly to the desired location under active tracking. In order to treat residual disease, multiparametric MR sequences can enhance the information available to the clinician. The precision availed by MR-guided brachytherapy results in substantial improvements in needle positioning, and resulting treatment plans."
0,PARP and PARG inhibitors in cancer treatment,32029455,2020/03/01,"Oxidative and replication stress underlie genomic instability of cancer cells. Amplifying genomic instability through radiotherapy and chemotherapy has been a powerful but nonselective means of killing cancer cells. Precision medicine has revolutionized cancer therapy by putting forth the concept of selective targeting of cancer cells. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors represent a successful example of precision medicine as the first drugs targeting DNA damage response to have entered the clinic. PARP inhibitors act through synthetic lethality with mutations in DNA repair genes and were approved for the treatment of <i>BRCA</i> mutated ovarian and breast cancer. PARP inhibitors destabilize replication forks through PARP DNA entrapment and induce cell death through replication stress-induced mitotic catastrophe. Inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) exploit and exacerbate replication deficiencies of cancer cells and may complement PARP inhibitors in targeting a broad range of cancer types with different sources of genomic instability. Here I provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms and cellular consequences of PARP and PARG inhibition. I highlight clinical performance of four PARP inhibitors used in cancer therapy (olaparib, rucaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib) and discuss the predictive biomarkers of inhibitor sensitivity, mechanisms of resistance as well as the means of overcoming them through combination therapy."
0,Managing Lung Cancer with Comorbid Interstitial Pneumonia,31534086,2020/01/15,"Systemic therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has dramatically changed in the latest 15 years. Molecular-targeted therapy has brought about an era of precision medicine, and immune checkpoint inhibitors have brought hope for a cure for advanced NSCLC. In the wake of this remarkable advancement, lung cancer with comorbid interstitial pneumonia (IP) has been completely left behind, as most clinical trials exclude patients with comorbid IP. IP, especially idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is often accompanied by lung cancer, and acute exacerbation can develop during various cancer therapies, including surgery, radiotherapy and pharmacotherapy. In this review, we focus on the clinical questions concerning pharmacotherapy in cases of advanced lung cancer with comorbid IP and discuss what we can do with the currently available data."
0,Neuroendocrine Neoplasms of the Small Bowel and Pancreas,31557758,2020/01/01,"The traditionally promulgated perspectives of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) as rare, indolent tumours are blunt and have been outdated for the last 2 decades. Clear increments in their incidence over the past decades render them increasingly clinically relevant, and at initial diagnosis many present with nodal and/or distant metastases (notably hepatic). The molecular pathogenesis of these tumours is increasingly yet incompletely understood. Those arising from the small bowel (SB) or pancreas typically occur sporadically; the latter may occur within the context of hereditary tumour predisposition syndromes. NENs can also be associated with endocrinopathy of hormonal hypersecretion. Tangible advances in the development of novel biomarkers, functional imaging modalities and therapy are especially applicable to this sub-set of tumours. The management of SB and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (NET) may be challenging, and often comprises a multidisciplinary approach wherein surgical, medical, interventional radiological and radiotherapeutic modalities are implemented. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of SB and pancreatic NETs. Moreover, we provide an outlook of the future in these tumour types which will include the development of precision oncology frameworks for individualised therapy, multi-analyte predictive biomarkers, artificial intelligence-derived clinical decision support tools and elucidation of the role of the microbiome in NEN development and clinical behaviour."
0,Immunological impact of cell death signaling driven by radiation on the tumor microenvironment,31873291,2020/2/01,"Therapeutic irradiation of the tumor microenvironment causes differential activation of pro-survival and pro-death pathways in malignant, stromal, endothelial and immune cells, hence causing a profound cellular and biological reconfiguration via multiple, non-redundant mechanisms. Such mechanisms include the selective elimination of particularly radiosensitive cell types and consequent loss of specific cellular functions, the local release of cytokines and danger signals by dying radiosensitive cells, and altered cytokine secretion by surviving radioresistant cells. Altogether, these processes create chemotactic and immunomodulatory cues for incoming and resident immune cells. Here we discuss how cytoprotective and cytotoxic signaling modules activated by radiation in specific cell populations reshape the immunological tumor microenvironment."
0,Current approaches to the management of brain metastases,32080373,2020/5/01,"Brain metastases are a very common manifestation of cancer that have historically been approached as a single disease entity given the uniform association with poor clinical outcomes. Fortunately, our understanding of the biology and molecular underpinnings of brain metastases has greatly improved, resulting in more sophisticated prognostic models and multiple patient-related and disease-specific treatment paradigms. In addition, the therapeutic armamentarium has expanded from whole-brain radiotherapy and surgery to include stereotactic radiosurgery, targeted therapies and immunotherapies, which are often used sequentially or in combination. Advances in neuroimaging have provided additional opportunities to accurately screen for intracranial disease at initial cancer diagnosis, target intracranial lesions with precision during treatment and help differentiate the effects of treatment from disease progression by incorporating functional imaging. Given the numerous available treatment options for patients with brain metastases, a multidisciplinary approach is strongly recommended to personalize the treatment of each patient in an effort to improve the therapeutic ratio. Given the ongoing controversies regarding the optimal sequencing of the available and expanding treatment options for patients with brain metastases, enrolment in clinical trials is essential to advance our understanding of this complex and common disease. In this Review, we describe the key features of diagnosis, risk stratification and modern paradigms in the treatment and management of patients with brain metastases and provide speculation on future research directions."
0,Therapeutic strategies for the costimulatory molecule OX40 in T-cell-mediated immunity,32140389,2020/3/01,"The T cell co-stimulatory molecule OX40 and its cognate ligand OX40L have attracted broad research interest as a therapeutic target in T cell-mediated diseases. Accumulating preclinical evidence highlights the therapeutic efficacy of both agonist and blockade of the OX40-OX40L interaction. Despite this progress, many questions about the immuno-modulator roles of OX40 on T cell function remain unanswered. In this review we summarize the impact of the OX40-OX40L interaction on T cell subsets, including Th1, Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, Treg, Tfh, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, to gain a comprehensive understanding of anti-OX40 mAb-based therapies. The potential therapeutic application of the OX40-OX40L interaction in autoimmunity diseases and cancer immunotherapy are further discussed; OX40-OX40L blockade may ameliorate autoantigen-specific T cell responses and reduce immune activity in autoimmunity diseases. We also explore the rationale of targeting OX40-OX40L interactions in cancer immunotherapy. Ligation of OX40 with targeted agonist anti-OX40 mAbs conveys activating signals to T cells. When combined with other therapeutic treatments, such as anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 blockade, cytokines, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy, the anti-tumor activity of agonist anti-OX40 treatment will be further enhanced. These data collectively suggest great potential for OX40-mediated therapies."
0,Paediatric proton therapy,31529979,2020/3/01,"Proton beam therapy is a highly conformal form of radiation therapy, which currently represents an important therapeutic component in multidisciplinary management in paediatric oncology. The precise adjustability of protons results in a reduction of radiation-related long-term side-effects and secondary malignancy induction, which is of particular importance for the quality of life. Proton irradiation has been shown to offer significant advantages over conventional photon-based radiotherapy, although the biological effectiveness of both irradiation modalities is comparable. This review evaluates current data from clinical and dosimetric studies on the treatment of tumours of the central nervous system, soft tissue and bone sarcomas of the head and neck region, paraspinal or pelvic region, and retinoblastoma. To date, the clinical results of irradiating childhood tumours with high-precision proton therapy are promising both with regard to tumour cure and the reduction of adverse events. Modern proton therapy techniques such as pencil beam scanning and intensity modulation are increasingly established modern facilities. However, further investigations with larger patient cohorts and longer follow-up periods are required, in order to be able to have clear evidence on clinical benefits."
0,"Consensus guidelines for the definition, detection and interpretation of immunogenic cell death",32209603,2020/3/01,"Cells succumbing to stress via regulated cell death (RCD) can initiate an adaptive immune response associated with immunological memory, provided they display sufficient antigenicity and adjuvanticity. Moreover, multiple intracellular and microenvironmental features determine the propensity of RCD to drive adaptive immunity. Here, we provide an updated operational definition of immunogenic cell death (ICD), discuss the key factors that dictate the ability of dying cells to drive an adaptive immune response, summarize experimental assays that are currently available for the assessment of ICD in vitro and in vivo, and formulate guidelines for their interpretation."
0,Precision medicine for gastrointestinal cancer: Recent progress and future perspective,31966910,2020/01/15,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer has a high tumor incidence and mortality rate worldwide. Despite significant improvements in radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy for GI cancer over the last decade, GI cancer is characterized by high recurrence rates and a dismal prognosis. There is an urgent need for new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Recent technological advances and the accumulation of clinical data are moving toward the use of precision medicine in GI cancer. Here we review the application and status of precision medicine in GI cancer. Analyses of liquid biopsy specimens provide comprehensive real-time data of the tumor-associated changes in an individual GI cancer patient with malignancy. With the introduction of gene panels including next-generation sequencing, it has become possible to identify a variety of mutations and genetic biomarkers in GI cancer. Although the genomic aberration of GI cancer is apparently less actionable compared to other solid tumors, novel informative analyses derived from comprehensive gene profiling may lead to the discovery of precise molecular targeted drugs. These progressions will make it feasible to incorporate clinical, genome-based, and phenotype-based diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and apply them to individual GI cancer patients for precision medicine."
0,Screening for differentiated thyroid cancer in selected populations,31591051,2020/1/01,"The main purpose of cancer screening programmes should not be to detect all cancers, but to discover potentially fatal or clinically relevant cancers. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for thyroid cancer in the general, asymptomatic adult population, as such screening would result in harms that outweigh any potential benefits. This recommendation does not apply to patients with symptoms or to individuals at increased risk of thyroid cancer because of a history of exposure to ionising radiation (in childhood, as radioactive fallout, or in medical treatment as low-dose radiotherapy for benign conditions or high-dose radiation for malignancy), inherited genetic syndromes associated with thyroid cancer (eg, familial adenomatous polyposis), or one or more first-degree relatives with a history of thyroid cancer. We discuss the evidence for and against screening individuals who are at high risk, and consider the different screening tools available."
0,Revealing and Harnessing Tumour-Associated Microglia/Macrophage Heterogeneity in Glioblastoma,31973030,2020/01/21,"<b>A</b><b>bstract</b>: Cancer heterogeneity and progression are subject to complex interactions between neoplastic cells and their microenvironment, including the immune system. Although glioblastomas (GBMs) are classified as 'cold tumours' with very little lymphocyte infiltration, they can contain up to 30-40% of tumour-associated macrophages, reported to contribute to a supportive microenvironment that facilitates tumour proliferation, survival and migration. In GBM, tumour-associated macrophages comprise either resident parenchymal microglia, perivascular macrophages or peripheral monocyte-derived cells. They are recruited by GBMs and in turn release growth factors and cytokines that affect the tumour. Notably, tumour-associated microglia/macrophages (TAMs) acquire different expression programs, which shape the tumour microenvironment and contribute to GBM molecular subtyping. Further, emerging evidence highlights that TAM programs may adapt to specific tumour features and landscapes. Here, we review key evidence describing TAM transcriptional and functional heterogeneity in GBM. We propose that unravelling the intricate complexity and diversity of the myeloid compartment as well as understanding how different TAM subsets may affect tumour progression will possibly pave the way to new immune therapeutic avenues for GBM patients."
0,'Omics Approaches to Explore the Breast Cancer Landscape,32039208,2020/01/22,"Breast cancer incidence is increasing worldwide with more than 600,000 deaths reported in 2018 alone. In current practice treatment options for breast cancer patients consists of surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy or targeting of classical markers of breast cancer subtype: estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2. However, these treatments fail to prevent recurrence and metastasis. Improved understanding of breast cancer and metastasis biology will help uncover novel biomarkers and therapeutic opportunities to improve patient stratification and treatment. We will first provide an overview of current methods and models used to study breast cancer biology, focusing on 2D and 3D cell culture, including organoids, and on <i>in vivo</i> models such as the MMTV mouse model and patient-derived xenografts (PDX). Next, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic approaches and their integration will be considered in the context of breast cancer susceptibility, breast cancer drivers, and therapeutic response and resistance to treatment. Finally, we will discuss how 'Omics datasets in combination with traditional breast cancer models are useful for generating insights into breast cancer biology, for suggesting individual treatments in precision oncology, and for creating data repositories to undergo further meta-analysis. System biology has the potential to catalyze the next great leap forward in treatment options for breast cancer patients."
0,Novel Therapeutics for Recurrent Cervical Cancer: Moving Towards Personalized Therapy,31939072,2020/2/01,"While screening programs and HPV vaccination have decreased the incidence of cervical cancer, still over 13,000 cases occur in the USA annually. Early-stage cervical cancer has an excellent long-term prognosis, with 5-year survival for localized disease being &gt; 90%. Survival decreases markedly for both locally advanced and metastatic disease, and both are associated with a higher risk of recurrence. Few effective treatment options exist for persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer. In 2014, the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab was approved in combination with chemotherapy based on the results of the Phase III GOG-240 study. As the majority of cervical cancers have a viral etiology, which impairs the immune system, immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and other agents, appears to be a promising approach. In June 2018, the US FDA approved the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab for recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with PD-L1 expression that progressed after one or more lines of chemotherapy. Another anti-PD1 antibody, cemiplimab also shows potential in this setting, either as monotherapy or combined with radiotherapy, and it is currently being evaluated in a Phase III trial. Additional checkpoint inhibitors including nivolumab, durvalumab, atezolizumab, and camrelizumab are in different stages of clinical development for the disease. Finally, an additional targeted approach being pursued involves PARP inhibitors (rucaparib and olaparib are both in Phase II) based on earlier study results."
0,Radiation-induced tissue damage and response,31990369,2020/4/01,"Normal tissue responses to ionizing radiation have been a major subject for study since the discovery of X-rays at the end of the 19th century. Shortly thereafter, time-dose relationships were established for some normal tissue endpoints that led to investigations into how the size of dose per fraction and the quality of radiation affected outcome. The assessment of the radiosensitivity of bone marrow stem cells using colony-forming assays by Till and McCulloch prompted the establishment of in situ clonogenic assays for other tissues that added to the radiobiology toolbox. These clonogenic and functional endpoints enabled mathematical modeling to be performed that elucidated how tissue structure, and in particular turnover time, impacted clinically relevant fractionated radiation schedules. More recently, lineage tracing technology, advanced imaging and single cell sequencing have shed further light on the behavior of cells within stem, and other, cellular compartments, both in homeostasis and after radiation damage. The discovery of heterogeneity within the stem cell compartment and plasticity in response to injury have added new dimensions to the consideration of radiation-induced tissue damage. Clinically, radiobiology of the 20th century garnered wisdom relevant to photon treatments delivered to a fairly wide field at around 2 Gy per fraction, 5 days per week, for 5-7 weeks. Recently, the scope of radiobiology has been extended by advances in technology, imaging and computing, as well as by the use of charged particles. These allow radiation to be delivered more precisely to tumors while minimizing the amount of normal tissue receiving high doses. One result has been an increase in the use of schedules with higher doses per fraction given in a shorter time frame (hypofractionation). We are unable to cover these new technologies in detail in this review, just as we must omit low-dose stochastic effects, and many aspects of dose, dose rate and radiation quality. We argue that structural diversity and plasticity within tissue compartments provides a general context for discussion of most radiation responses, while acknowledging many omissions. © 2020 The Authors.

0,Molecular Evolution of IDH Wild-Type Glioblastomas Treated With Standard of Care Affects Survival and Design of Precision Medicine Trials: A Report From the EORTC 1542 Study,31743054,2020/01/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>Precision medicine trials in glioblastoma (GBM) are often conducted at tumor recurrence. However, second surgeries for recurrent GBM are not routinely performed, and therefore, molecular data for trial inclusion are predominantly derived from the primary sample. This study aims to establish whether molecular targets change during tumor progression and, if so, whether this affects precision medicine trial design.</p><h3>Materials and methods</h3><p>We collected 186 pairs of primary-recurrent GBM samples from patients receiving chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide and sequenced approximately 300 cancer genes. <i>MGMT</i>, <i>TERT</i>, and <i>EGFRvIII</i> status was individually determined.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The molecular profile of our cohort was identical to that of other GBM cohorts (<i>IDH</i> wild-type [WT], 95%; <i>EGFR</i> amplified, approximately 50%), indicating that patients amenable to second surgery do not represent a specific molecular subtype. Molecular events in <i>IDH</i> WT GBMs were stable in approximately 80% of events, but changes in mutation status were observed for all examined genes (range, approximately 90% and 60% for <i>TERT</i> and <i>EGFR</i> mutations, respectively), and such changes strongly affected targeted trial size and design. A similar pattern of GBM driver instability was observed within <i>MGMT</i> promoter-methylated tumors. <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation status remained prognostic at tumor recurrence. The observation that hypermutation at GBM recurrence was rare (8%) and not correlated with outcome was relevant for immunotherapy-based treatments.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>This large cohort of matched primary and recurrent <i>IDH</i> WT tumors establishes the frequency of GBM driver instability after chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide. This allows per gene or pathway calculation of trial size at tumor recurrence, using molecular data of the primary tumor only. We also identify genes for which repeat surgery is necessary because of low mutation retention rate.</p>"
0,Laparoscopic and robotic lateral lymph node dissection for rectal cancer,31989237,2020/3/01,"In the era of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision, overall oncological outcomes after curative resection of rectal cancer are excellent, with local recurrence rates as low as 5-10%. However, lateral nodal disease is a major cause of local recurrence after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy/radiotherapy and total mesorectal excision. Patients with lateral nodal disease have a local recurrence rate of up to 30%. The oncological benefits of lateral pelvic lymph node dissection (LPLND) in reducing local recurrence, particularly in the lateral compartment, have been demonstrated. Although LPLND is not standard in Western countries, technical improvements in minimally invasive surgery have resulted in rapid technical standardization of this complicated procedure. The feasibility and short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic and robotic LPLND have been reported widely. A minimally invasive approach has the advantages of less bleeding and providing a better surgical view of the deep pelvic anatomy than an open approach. With precise autonomic nerve preservation, postoperative genitourinary dysfunction has been reported to be minimal. We review recent evidence on the management of lateral nodal disease in rectal cancer and technical improvements of LPLND, focusing on laparoscopic and robotic LPLND."
0,Do cancer therapies damage the uterus and compromise fertility?,31863097,2020/02/28,"<h3>Background</h3><p>As cancer survival rates improve, understanding and preventing the adverse off-target and long-term impacts of cancer treatments, including impacts on fertility, have become increasingly important. Cancer therapy-mediated damage to the ovary and depletion of the primordial follicle reserve are well characterised. However, our knowledge of the full extent of damage to the rest of the female reproductive tract, in particular the uterus, is limited.</p><h3>Objective and rationale</h3><p>Improving our understanding of the off-target effects of cancer therapies on the entire female reproductive tract is a critical step towards developing truly effective strategies to protect the fertility of cancer survivors. The objective of this narrative review was to critically evaluate the available literature regarding the capacity for the uterus to sustain a healthy pregnancy following exposure to radiotherapy or chemotherapy.</p><h3>Search methods</h3><p>The authors performed PubMed (Medline) searches using the following key words: uterus, cancer survivors, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, pregnancy outcome, fertility preservation, infertility. There were no limits placed on time of publication.</p><h3>Outcomes</h3><p>Overall, there were major limitations to the current available literature, meaning that interpretations should be taken with caution. Despite these drawbacks, data suggest that the uterus may sustain off-target damage, with the extent of damage dependent on the type of cancer treatment and patient age. Specifically, uterine growth is stunted and resistant to hormone replacement therapy in prepubertal girls receiving abdominal, pelvic or whole-body radiotherapy. In contrast, females treated with radiotherapy post-puberty can benefit from hormone replacement therapy, as demonstrated by increased uterine volume and function. No live births have been reported in women previously exposed to radiotherapy after transplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue, even when menstruation returns. However, this technique has proven to be a successful fertility preservation method for women previously treated with chemotherapy. Obstetricians commonly report that women who maintain sufficient ovarian function can achieve pregnancy naturally following radiotherapy, but they have thin and/or fibrotic myometrium at delivery, compromising safe delivery and subsequent pregnancy. Furthermore, women exposed to either radiotherapy or chemotherapy have a higher prevalence of preterm birth and low birth weight infants, even in those with normal ovarian function or when oocyte donation is utilised. The mechanisms of potential uterine damage are poorly understood. While the myometrium, vasculature and endometrial progenitor cells are possibly targets, further studies are clearly required and well-controlled animal models could provide the best avenue for these types of future investigations.</p><h3>Wider implications</h3><p>Female cancer survivors experience greater rates of early pregnancy loss and complications, suggesting that cancer therapy-induced damage to the uterus contributes to infertility. Despite clinical reports dating back to 1989, we highlight a surprising lack of detail in the literature regarding the precise nature and extent of off-target damage inflicted to the uterus in response to cancer therapies. Young women requiring cancer treatment, and the clinicians treating them, must be equipped with accurate information to aid informed decision-making regarding cancer treatment regimens as well as the development and use of effective fertility preservation measures. As the current literature on the impacts of cancer treatments is limited, we hope that our narrative review on this subject will stimulate more research in this important field.</p>"
0,Postoperative glioma segmentation in CT image using deep feature fusion model guided by multi-sequence MRIs,31650265,2020/2/01,"<h3>Objectives</h3><p>Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the most commonly selected methods for imaging gliomas. Clinically, radiotherapists always delineate the CT glioma region with reference to multi-modal MR image information. On this basis, we develop a deep feature fusion model (DFFM) guided by multi-sequence MRIs for postoperative glioma segmentation in CT images.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>DFFM is a multi-sequence MRI-guided convolutional neural network (CNN) that iteratively learns the deep features from CT images and multi-sequence MR images simultaneously by utilizing a multi-channel CNN architecture, and then combines these two deep features together to produce the segmentation result. The whole network is optimized together via a standard back-propagation. A total of 59 CT and MRI datasets (T1/T2-weighted FLAIR, T1-weighted contrast-enhanced, T2-weighted) of postoperative gliomas as tumor grade II (n = 24), grade III (n = 18), or grade IV (n = 17) were included. Dice coefficient (DSC), precision, and recall were used to measure the overlap between automated segmentation results and manual segmentation. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for statistical analysis.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>DFFM showed a significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher DSC of 0.836 than U-Net trained by single CT images and U-Net trained by stacking the CT and multi-sequence MR images, which yielded 0.713 DSC and 0.818 DSC, respectively. The precision values showed similar behavior as DSC. Moreover, DSC and precision values have no significant statistical difference (p &gt; 0.01) with difference grades.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>DFFM enables the accurate automated segmentation of CT postoperative gliomas of profit guided by multi-sequence MR images and may thus improve and facilitate radiotherapy planning.</p><h3>Key points</h3><p>• A fully automated deep learning method was developed to segment postoperative gliomas on CT images guided by multi-sequence MRIs. • CT and multi-sequence MR image integration allows for improvements in deep learning postoperative glioma segmentation method. • This deep feature fusion model produces reliable segmentation results and could be useful in delineating GTV in postoperative glioma radiotherapy planning.</p>"

The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference (APCCC) 2019 addressed some of these topics to supplement guidelines that are based on level 1 evidence.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To present the results from the APCCC 2019.</p><h3>Design, setting, and participants</h3><p>Similar to prior conferences, experts identified 10 important areas of controversy regarding the management of advanced prostate cancer: locally advanced disease, biochemical recurrence after local therapy, treating the primary tumour in the metastatic setting, metastatic hormone-sensitive/naïve prostate cancer, nonmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, bone health and bone metastases, molecular characterisation of tissue and blood, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, and adverse effects of hormonal therapy and their management. A panel of 72 international prostate cancer experts developed the programme and the consensus questions.</p><h3>Outcome measurements and statistical analysis</h3><p>The panel voted publicly but anonymously on 123 predefined questions, which were developed by both voting and nonvoting panel members prior to the conference following a modified Delphi process.</p><h3>Results and limitations</h3><p>Panellists voted based on their opinions rather than a standard literature review or formal meta-analysis. The answer options for the consensus questions had varying degrees of support by the panel, as reflected in this article and the detailed voting results reported in the Supplementary material.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>These voting results from a panel of prostate cancer experts can help clinicians and patients navigate controversial areas of advanced prostate management for which high-level evidence is sparse. However, diagnostic and treatment decisions should always be individualised based on patient-specific factors, such as disease extent and location, prior lines of therapy, comorbidities, and treatment preferences, together with current and emerging clinical evidence and logistic and economic constraints. Clinical trial enrolment for men with advanced prostate cancer should be strongly encouraged. Importantly, APCCC 2019 once again identified important questions that merit assessment in specifically designed trials.</p><h3>Patient summary</h3><p>The Advanced Prostate Cancer Consensus Conference provides a forum to discuss and debate current diagnostic and treatment options for patients with advanced prostate cancer. The conference, which has been held three times since 2015, aims to share the knowledge of world experts in prostate cancer management with health care providers worldwide. At the end of the conference, an expert panel discusses and votes on predefined consensus questions that target the most clinically relevant areas of advanced prostate cancer treatment. The results of the voting provide a practical guide to help clinicians discuss therapeutic options with patients as part of shared and multidisciplinary decision making.</p>"
0,Surgical treatment following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced rectal cancer,31814296,2020/3/01,"Colorectal cancer is a major public health problem worldwide, and locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) is known for its poor prognosis. A multimodal treatment approach is the only method to achieve satisfactory local recurrence and survival rates in LARC. Determining which therapeutic modality for LARC has the most satisfactory influence on quality of life and disease outcome is still controversial. LARC treatment is subject to continuous advancement due to the development of new and better diagnostic tools, radiotherapy techniques, and chemotherapeutic agents. Herein, we review various therapeutic modalities for LARC from several aspects. In addition to radiotherapy techniques such as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT), we discuss the progress of chemotherapy, appropriate time interval between NCRT and surgery, relationship between tumor location and NCRT efficacy/safety, wait-and-watch policy, and predictors of treatment response following NCRT. Because of the controversies and unanswered questions regarding NCRT treatments for LARC, additional investigations are required to determine which therapeutic approach is the most feasible for LARC patients."

We then fit generalized competing event models to determine the effect of comorbidity and other covariates on the ω<sup>+</sup> ratio.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The ω score was effective in stratifying patients with HNC according to their risk for cancer recurrence relative to competing mortality, especially among patients aged &gt;70 years. Patients with ω score ≥0.80 were more likely to receive intensive therapy compared with patients with a ω score &lt;0.80 (66 vs. 54%; P &lt; .001). On multivariable generalized competing event regression, T2-4 category (relative hazard ratio [RHR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.16), N2-3 category (RHR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.15), and being employed (RHR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03-1.20) were associated with increased ω<sup>+</sup> ratio, and increasing age (RHR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.78-0.89), Charlson comorbidity index ≥2 (RHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.79-0.91), being a current smoker (RHR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.84-0.96), and lower body mass index (RHR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.95) were associated with a decreased ω<sup>+</sup> ratio.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>The ω scores are effective in stratifying patients with HNC and are correlated with the intensity of treatment given. The ω scores incorporating comorbidity and other risk factors could help identify patients with HNC most likely to benefit from intensive therapy.</p>"

Here we aimed to develop an in vivo test to directly challenge living cancer cells to radiotherapy, using zebrafish xenografts.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We generated zebrafish xenografts using colorectal cancer cell lines and patient biopsies without in vitro passaging, and developed a fast radiotherapy protocol consisting of a single dose of 25 Gy. As readouts of the impact of radiotherapy we analyzed proliferation, apoptosis, tumor size and DNA damage.</p><h3>Findings</h3><p>By directly comparing isogenic cells that only differ in the KRAS<sup>G13D</sup> allele, we show that it is possible to distinguish radiosensitive from radioresistant tumors in zebrafish xenografts, even in polyclonal tumors, in just 4 days. Most importantly, we performed proof-of-concept experiments using primary rectum biopsies, where clinical response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy correlates with induction of apoptosis in their matching zebrafish Patient-Derived Xenografts-Avatars.</p><h3>Interpretation</h3><p>Our work opens the possibility to predict tumor responses to radiotherapy using the zebrafish Avatar model, sparing valuable therapeutic time and unnecessary toxicity.</p>"
0,Molecular Mechanisms of Radiation-Induced Cancer Cell Death: A Primer,32117972,2020/02/13,"Radiation therapy (RT) is responsible for at least 40% of cancer cures, however treatment resistance remains a clinical problem. There have been recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of radiation-induced cell death. The type of cell death after radiation depends on a number of factors including cell type, radiation dose and quality, oxygen tension, <i>TP53</i> status, DNA repair capacity, cell cycle phase at time of radiation exposure, and the microenvironment. Mitotic catastrophe (a pathway preceding cell death that happens in mitosis or as a consequence of aberrant mitotic progression) is the primary context of radiation-induced cell death in solid cancers, although in a small subset of cancers such as haematopoietic malignancies, radiation results in immediate interphase apoptosis, occurring within hours after exposure. There is intense therapeutic interest in using stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR), a precise, high-dose form of RT given in a small number of fractions, to prime the immune system for cancer cell killing, but the optimal radiation dose and fractionation remain unclear. Additionally, promising novel radiosensitisers targeting the cell cycle and DNA repair pathways are being trialled. In the context of the increasing use of SABR and such novel agents in the clinic, we provide an updated primer on the major types of radiation-induced cell death, focussing on their molecular mechanisms, factors affecting their initiation, and their implications on immunogenicity."

Measurements were conducted on a homogeneous phantom and in the brain of healthy volunteers at 3 tesla. Conductivity maps were reconstructed with Helmholtz-based electrical properties tomography. In measurements, PLANET was also compared to a reference technique for transceive phase mapping, i.e., spin echo.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Accuracy and precision of ϕ<sup>±</sup> estimated with PLANET depended on the chosen flip angle and TR. PLANET-based ϕ<sup>±</sup> was less sensitive to perturbations induced by off-resonance effects and partial volume (e.g., white matter + myelin) than bSSFP-based ϕ<sup>±</sup> . For flip angle = 25° and TR = 4.6 ms, PLANET showed an accuracy comparable to that of reference spin echo but a higher precision than bSSFP and spin echo (factor of 2 and 3, respectively). The acquisition time for PLANET was ~5 min; 2 min faster than spin echo and 8 times slower than bSSFP. However, PLANET simultaneously reconstructed T<sub>1</sub> , T<sub>2</sub> , B<sub>0</sub> maps besides mapping ϕ<sup>±</sup> . In the phantom, PLANET-based conductivity matched the true value and had the smallest spread of the three methods. In vivo, PLANET-based conductivity was similar to spin echo-based conductivity.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Provided that appropriate sequence parameters are used, PLANET delivers accurate and precise ϕ<sup>±</sup> maps, which can be used to reconstruct brain tissue conductivity while simultaneously recovering T<sub>1</sub> , T<sub>2</sub> , and B<sub>0</sub> maps.</p>"
0,The relative biological effectiveness of proton irradiation in dependence of DNA damage repair,31687835,2020/3/01,"Clinical parameters and empirical evidence are the primary determinants for current treatment planning in radiation oncology. Personalized medicine in radiation oncology is only at the very beginning to take the genetic background of a tumor entity into consideration to define an individual treatment regimen, the total dose or the combination with a specific anticancer agent. Likewise, stratification of patients towards proton radiotherapy is linked to its physical advantageous energy deposition at the tumor site with minimal healthy tissue being co-irradiated distal to the target volume. Hence, the fact that photon and proton irradiation also induce different qualities of DNA damages, which require differential DNA damage repair mechanisms has been completely neglected so far. These subtle differences could be efficiently exploited in a personalized treatment approach and could be integrated into personalized treatment planning. A differential requirement of the two major DNA double-strand break repair pathways, homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining, was recently identified in response to proton and photon irradiation, respectively, and subsequently influence the mode of ionizing radiation-induced cell death and susceptibility of tumor cells with defects in DNA repair machineries to either quality of ionizing radiation.This review focuses on the differential DNA-damage responses and subsequent biological processes induced by photon and proton irradiation in dependence of the genetic background and discusses their impact on the unicellular level and in the tumor microenvironment and their implications for combined treatment modalities."

AI applications are currently spanning many diverse fields from economics to entertainment, to manufacturing, as well as medicine. Since modern AI's inception decades ago, practitioners in radiological sciences have been pioneering its development and implementation in medicine, particularly in areas related to diagnostic imaging and therapy. In this anniversary article, we embark on a journey to reflect on the learned lessons from past AI's chequered history. We further summarize the current status of AI in radiological sciences, highlighting, with examples, its impressive achievements and effect on re-shaping the practice of medical imaging and radiotherapy in the areas of computer-aided detection, diagnosis, prognosis, and decision support.

0,Using a TRAPS upstream transmission detector to verify multileaf collimator positions during dynamic radiotherapy delivery,31790976,2020/2/01,"With the advancement of high-precision radiotherapy and the increasing use of higher intensity beams, the risk to the patient increases should the radiotherapy machine malfunction. Hence more accurate treatment verification is required. In this paper we provide a solution for real-time monitoring of X-ray beams from radiotherapy linear accelerators using monolithic active pixel sensors. We show that leaf errors can be detected with high precision in static fields and IMRT step and shoot, and accurate leaf tracking is possible in Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy. The prototype MAPS detector meets the criteria of 1% attenuation acceptable for clinical use."
0,Initial assessment of 3D magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) towards quantitative brain imaging for radiation therapy,31834641,2020/3/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>Magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) provides quantitative T1/T2 maps, enabling applications in clinical radiotherapy such as large-scale, multi-center clinical trials for longitudinal assessment of therapy response. We evaluated the feasibility of a quantitative three-dimensional-MRF (3D-MRF) towards its radiotherapy applications of primary brain tumors.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A fast whole-brain 3D-MRF sequence initially developed for diagnostic radiology was optimized using flexible body coils, which is the typical MR imaging setup for radiotherapy treatment planning and for MR imaging (MRI)-guided treatment delivery. Optimization criteria included the accuracy and the precision of T1/T2 quantifications of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solutions, compared to those from the 3D-MRF using a 32-channel head coil. The accuracy of T1/T2 quantifications from the optimized MRF was first examined in healthy volunteers with two different coil setups. The intra- and inter-scanner variations of image intensity from the optimized sequence were quantified by longitudinal scans of the PVP solutions on two 3T scanners. Using a 3D-printed MRI geometry phantom, susceptibility-induced distortion with the optimized 3D-MRF was quantified as the Dice coefficient of phantom contours, compared to those from CT images. By introducing intentional head motion during 10% of the scan, the robustness of the optimized 3D-MRF towards motion was evaluated through visual inspection of motion artifacts and through quantitative analysis of image sharpness in brain MRF maps.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The optimized sequence acquired whole-brain T1, T2 and proton density maps and with a resolution of 1.2 × 1.2 × 3 mm<sup>3</sup> in 10 min, similar to the total acquisition time of 3D T1- and T2-weighted images of the same resolution. In vivo T1 and T2 values of the white and gray matter were consistent with literature. The intra- and inter-scanner variability of the intensity-normalized MRF T1 was 1.0% ± 0.7% and 2.3% ± 1.0% respectively, in contrast to 5.3% ± 3.8% and 3.2% ± 1.6% from the normalized T1-weighted MRI. Repeatability and reproducibility of MRF T1 were independent of intensity normalization. Both phantom and human data demonstrated that the optimized 3D-MRF is more robust to subject motion and artifacts from subject-specific susceptibility difference. Compared to CT contours, the Dice coefficient of phantom contours from 3D-MRF was 0.93, improved from 0.87 from the T1-weighted MRI.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Compared to conventional MRI, the optimized 3D-MRF demonstrated improved repeatability across time points and reproducibility across scanners for better tissue quantification, as well as improved robustness to subject-specific susceptibility and motion artifacts under a typical MR imaging setup for radiotherapy. More importantly, quantitative MRF T1/T2 measurements lead to promising potentials towards longitudinal quantitative assessment of treatment response for better adaptive therapy and for large-scale, multi-center clinical trials.</p>"
0,miRNAs as radio-response biomarkers for breast cancer stem cells,31930680,2020/3/01,"In breast cancer (BC), the presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has been related to relapse, metastasis, and radioresistance. Radiotherapy (RT) is an extended BC treatment, but is not always effective. CSCs have several mechanisms of radioresistance in place, and some miRNAs are involved in the cellular response to ionizing radiation (IR). Here, we studied how IR affects the expression of miRNAs related to stemness in different molecular BC subtypes. Exposition of BC cells to radiation doses of 2, 4, or 6 Gy affected their phenotype, functional characteristics, pluripotency gene expression, and in vivo tumorigenic capacity. This held true for various molecular subtypes of BC cells (classified by ER, PR and HER-2 status), and for BC cells either plated in monolayer, or being in suspension as mammospheres. However, the effect of IR on the expression of eight stemness- and radioresistance-related miRNAs (miR-210, miR-10b, miR-182, miR-142, miR-221, miR-21, miR-93, miR-15b) varied, depending on cell line subpopulation and clinicopathological features of BC patients. Therefore, clinicopathological features and, potentially also, chemotherapy regimen should be both taken into consideration, for determining a potential miRNA signature by liquid biopsy in BC patients treated with RT. Personalized and precision RT dosage regimes could improve the prognosis, treatment, and survival of BC patients."
0,Gender-dependent radiotherapy: The next step in personalised medicine?,31991224,2020/3/01,"Individuals do not react to radiation in a homogeneous manner. Recent radiogenomic research has proven that individual polymorphisms can correlate with treatment response most likely due to variation in the ability to recognise and repair DNA breaks. The difference in radiosensitivity between genders has been well documented, yet most radiotherapeutic guidelines are based solely on population averages rather than demographic subgroups such as age, race and gender. This paper is a review of the burgeoning literature available on the differences in efficacy and outcome of radiotherapy between genders. The work examines the effect of radiation on gender both from a tumour control as well as normal tissue toxicity perspective. While the literature reporting such findings is limited, the results show a small but significant difference in response to radiotherapy between sexes. Prospective and retrospective studies for evaluating these gender-specific differences are encouraged as a next step in personalised medicine."
0,The abscopal effect 67 years later: from a side story to center stage,32101479,2020/05/01,"For over a century, ionising radiation has been used to treat cancer based on its cytotoxic effects on tumour cells. Technical progress has enabled more precise targeting of the tumour to reduce normal tissue toxicity while delivering higher radiation doses per fraction of treatment.In 1953, unexpected regression in lesions outside of the irradiated field were noted by an observant physician, RH Mole, who named such phenomenon ""abscopal effect"" from the Latin <i>ab</i> (position away from) and <i>scopus</i> (mark or target), in an article published in this journal. Clinical abscopal responses have been reported over the years but because of their very rare occurrence they could not be methodically studied, remaining akin to a curiosity. Nevertheless, their occurrence has ignited interest in studying the systemic effects of radiotherapy. Progress in dissecting the mechanisms that govern the function of the immune system in cancer has enabled to study the implication of immunity in the abscopal effect of radiation. It has become clear that ionising radiation activates canonical pathways of response to viral infections, and can stimulate antitumour immunity. These immune stimulatory effects of radiation have become clinically relevant in the current era of cancer immunotherapy, rendering abscopal responses in patients an attainable aim. Here, we will briefly review the parallel evolutions of two separate fields of medicine, radiation therapy and cancer immunology, and discuss their therapeutic partnership."
0,Stereotactic Radiosurgery,31194323,2020/1/01,"Radiation therapy aims to destroy abnormal tissue, notably tumor cells, with minimal damage to surrounding normal tissue. Lars Leksell introduced stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in 1951 as an alternative treatment option to conventional whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT).SRS uses multiple, convergent beams of high energy x-rays, gamma rays, or protons, delivered to a discrete, radiographically-defined, treatment volume. The delivery of radiation is highly conformal. By using multiple, intersecting beams of radiation, the treatment volume receives a high, therapeutic prescription dose, while surrounding normal brain tissue receives a relatively low dose. This treatment can be tailored precisely, following margins of the treatment volume to allow rapid dissipation of energy beyond the margins, sparing normal tissue. The steep radiation fall-off into surrounding tissues limits toxicity and side effects and maintains safety.Stereotactic radiosurgery works by radiation-induced DNA damage by ions and free radicals. The vascular endothelium is the primary target with contribution from endothelial-cell apoptosis, microvascular dysfunction, and T-cell response. Histologically, a brisk inflammatory response and severe vasculopathy occur in lesions that respond well to SRS."
0,Role of combined radiation and androgen deprivation therapy in intermediate-risk prostate cancer : Statement from the DEGRO working group on prostate cancer,31784804,2020/2/01,"<h3>Objective</h3><p>This article aims to provide an overview of the role of combined radiation and androgen deprivation (ADT) therapy in patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer.</p><h3>Materials and methods</h3><p>The current German, European, and NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network) guidelines as well as relevant literature in the PubMed database which provide information on sub-classification within the intermediate-risk group and the use of ADT in terms of oncological outcome were reviewed.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Different recommendations for risk-group assessment of patients with localized prostate cancer are available. Subdivision of intermediate risk into a favorable and an unfavorable group seems to be justified to allow for a more individualized therapy in a quite heterogenous group of patients. So far, multiple randomized trials have shown a benefit when radiation therapy (RT) is combined with ADT. The use of dose-escalated RT without ADT also appears to be an adequate therapy associated with a very low rate of cancer-specific deaths. Therefore, taking into account the increased rate of toxicity associated with ADT, dose-escalated RT alone might be justified, especially in favorable intermediate-risk patients.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Dose-escalated RT alone appears to be an appropriate treatment in favorable intermediate-risk patients. Addition of short course ADT (4-6 months) might improve outcomes in unfavorable intermediate-risk patients.</p>"

Nowadays MBC is a nosological entity in its own right with biological, molecular and clinical features that require a multidisciplinary approach and the involvement of specific skills. Multimodal treatment involves surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It is evident that the outcome of the MBC is worse than the female one. MBC is often diagnosed in advanced stages. Screening programs in the male population need to be strengthened to obtain an earlier diagnosis. It is necessary to know even more in depth the endocrine-metabolic and behavioral risk factors related to the neoplasm. Finally in the coming years it is reasonable to expect an improvement in multigenic tests: the sensitivity of these methods could predict the risk of recurrence even more precisely.

0,Developing more sensitive genomic approaches to detect radioresponse in precision radiation oncology: From tissue DNA analysis to circulating tumor DNA,31837443,2020/03/01,"Despite the common application and considerable efforts to achieve precision radiotherapy (RT) in several types of cancer, RT has not yet entered the era of precision medicine; the ability to predict radiosensitivity and treatment responses in tumors and normal tissues is lacking. Therefore, development of genome-based methods for individual prognosis in radiation oncology is urgently required. Traditional DNA sequencing requires tissue samples collected during invasive operations; therefore, repeated tests are nearly impossible. Intra- and inter-tumoral heterogeneity may undermine the predictive power of a single assay from tumor samples. In contrast, analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) allows for non-invasive and near real-time sampling of tumors. By investigating the genetic composition of tumors and monitoring dynamic changes during treatment, ctDNA analysis may potentially be clinically valuable in prediction of treatment responses prior to RT, surveillance of responses during RT, and evaluation of residual disease following RT. As a biomarker for RT response, ctDNA profiling may guide personalized treatments. In this review, we will discuss approaches of tissue DNA sequencing and ctDNA detection and summarize their clinical applications in both traditional RT and in combination with immunotherapy."
0,Proton beam radiotherapy for anal and rectal cancers,32175121,2020/2/01,"Gastrointestinal cancers are bordered by radiosensitive visceral organs, resulting in a narrow therapeutic window. The search for more efficacious and tolerable therapies raises the possibility that proton beam therapy's (PBT) physical and dosimetric differences from conventional therapy may be better suited to treat both primary and recurrent disease, which carries its own unique challenges. Currently, the maximal efficacy of radiation plans for primary and recurrent anorectal cancer is constrained by delivery techniques and modalities which must consider feasibility challenges and toxicity secondary to exposure of organs at risk (OARs). Studies using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) demonstrate that more precise dose delivery to target volumes improves local control rates and reduces complications. By reducing the low-to-moderate radiation dose-bath to bone marrow, small and large bowel, and skin, PBT may offer an improved side-effect profile. The potential to reduce toxicity, increase patient compliance, minimize treatment breaks, and enable dose escalation or hypofractionation is appealing. In cases where prognosis is favorable, PBT may mitigate long-term morbidity such as secondary malignancies, femoral fractures, and small bowel obstruction."
0,Variation in the Use of Single- Versus Multifraction Palliative Radiation Therapy for Bone Metastases in Australia,31505246,2020/01/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>To evaluate the use of single-fraction palliative radiation therapy (SFRT) for the management of bone metastases (BM) in Victoria, Australia.</p><h3>Methods and materials</h3><p>This is a population-based cohort of patients with cancer who received radiation therapy for BM between 2012 and 2017 as captured in the Victorian Radiotherapy Minimum Data Set.

SFRT was less commonly given to the skull (4%) and spine (14%), compared with the shoulder (37%) and ribs (53%). Patients with lung cancer (21%) were most likely to receive SFRT, followed by those with prostate cancers (18%) and gastrointestinal cancers (16%). Patients from regional/remote areas were more likely to have SFRT compared with those in major cities (22% vs 16%, P &lt; .001). Patients treated in public institutions were more likely to have SFRT compared with those treated in private institutions (22% vs 10%, P &lt; .001).

0,Bidirectional Crosstalk Between Cancer Stem Cells and Immune Cell Subsets,32117287,2020/02/05,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs), also known as tumor-initiating cells, are characterized by an increased capacity for self-renewal, multipotency, and tumor initiation. While CSCs represent only a small proportion of the tumor mass, they significantly account for metastatic dissemination and tumor recurrence, thus making them attractive targets for therapy. Due to their ability to sustain in dormancy, chemo- and radiotherapy often fail to eliminate cancer cells with stemness properties. Recent advances in the understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) illustrated the importance of the immune contexture, determining the response to therapy and clinical outcome of patients. In this context, CSCs exhibit special properties to escape the recognition by innate and adaptive immunity and shape the TME into an immunosuppressive, pro-tumorigenic landscape. As CSCs sculpt the immune contexture, the phenotype and functional properties of the tumor-infiltrating immune cells in turn influence the differentiation and phenotype of tumor cells. In this review, we summarize recent studies investigating main immunomodulatory properties of CSCs and their underlying molecular mechanisms as well as the impact of immune cells on cancer cells with stemness properties. A deeper understanding of this bidirectional crosstalk shaping the immunological landscape and determining therapeutic responses will facilitate the improvement of current treatment modalities and the design of innovative strategies to precisely target CSCs."
0,Conventional Radiotherapy and Stereotactic Radiosurgery in the Management of Metastatic Spine Disease,32757820,2020/01/01,"Spinal metastases are a common manifestation of malignant tumors that can cause severe pain, spinal cord compression, pathological fractures, and hypercalcemia, and these clinical manifestations will ultimately reduce the health-related quality of life and even shorten life expectancy in patient with cancer. Effective management of spinal bone metastases requires multidisciplinary collaboration, including radiologists, surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical oncologists, and pain specialists. In the past few decades, conventional radiotherapy has been the most common form of radiotherapy, which can achieve favorable local control and pain relief; however, it lacks precise methods of delivering radiation and thus cannot provide sufficient tumoricidal dose. The advent of stereotactic radiosurgery has changed this situation by using highly focused radiation beams guided by 3-dimensional imaging to deliver a high biologic equivalent dose to the target region, and the spinal cord can be identified and excluded from the target volume to reduce the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy. Separation surgery can provide a 2- to 3-mm safe separation of tumor and spinal cord to avoid radiation-induced damage to the spinal cord. Targets for separation surgery include decompression of metastatic epidural spinal cord compression and spinal stabilization without partial or en bloc tumor resection. Combined with conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery can provide better local tumor control and pain relief. Several scoring systems have been developed to estimate the life expectancy of patients with spinal metastases treated with radiotherapy. Thorough understanding of radiotherapy-related knowledge including the dose-fractionation schedule, separation surgery, efficacy and safety, scoring systems, and feasibility of combination with other treatment methods is critical to providing optimal patient care."

0,High-dimensional immune-profiling in cancer: implications for immunotherapy,32034066,2020/2/01,"Immunotherapy is a rapidly growing field for cancer treatment. In contrast to conventional cancer therapies, immunotherapeutic strategies focus on reactivating the immune system to mount an antitumor response. Despite the encouraging outcome in clinical trials, a large proportion of patients still do not respond to treatment and many experience different degrees of immune-related adverse events. Furthermore, it is now increasingly appreciated that even many conventional cancer therapies such as radiotherapy could have a positive impact on the host immune system for better clinical response. Hence, there is a need to better understand tumor immunity in order to design immunotherapeutic strategies, especially evidence-based combination therapies, for improved clinical outcomes. With this aim, cancer research turned its attention to profiling the immune contexture of either the tumor microenvironment (TME) or peripheral blood to uncover mechanisms and biomarkers which might aid in precision immunotherapeutics. Conventional technologies used for this purpose were limited by the depth and dimensionality of the data. Advances in newer techniques have, however, greatly improved the breadth and depth, as well as the quantity and quality of data that can be obtained. The result of these advances is a wealth of new information and insights on how the TME could be affected by various immune cell-types, and how this might in turn impact the clinical outcome of cancer patients . We highlight herein some of the high-dimensional technologies currently employed in immune profiling in cancer and summarize the insights and potential benefits they could bring in designing better cancer immunotherapies."
0,Radiation Effects On The Fetus,33232028,2020/1/01,"Embryogenesis is a complex process and is divided between pre-implantation, embryo, and fetal period. This process is highly susceptible to various external factors such as teratogenic drugs, alcohol, smoking, radiation, and even the lack of appropriate nutrition. Ionizing radiation way more than non-ionizing has known effects in developing fetus with fatal outcomes. Malignancy is relatively uncommon during pregnancy, with a low incidence of 0.02 to 0.1%. The most common malignancies found are breast, skin including melanoma, gynecological (uterine, cervix, and ovarian), and hematological (Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)). Generally, when rivaled with patients who received surgical monotherapy, survivors who underwent abdominopelvic radiation with or without surgery were more likely to have infants that were premature, low–birth weight, and even associated with perinatal mortality in few cases. Various studies have demonstrated an increased risk of unfavorable pregnancy and neonatal outcomes with prior history of abdominopelvic irradiation, possibly due to radiation-induced uterine damage. Since high-dose uterine irradiation can restrict the pregnant uterus' growth and cause vascular changes that impair uterine blood flow, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth are common. Signorello et al. observed that infants of patients treated with high-dose radiotherapy (&gt;5 Gy) to the uterus were at a heightened risk of preterm delivery, low birth weight, and small for gestational age when compared with offspring of patients who did not receive radiotherapy. Green et al. observed that the incidence of fetal malposition, early or threatened labor, low birth weight, and prematurity were higher with elevated radiation doses. When compared to radiotherapy, chemotherapy does not appear to have harmful effects on the uterus. Hence it generally has favorable pregnancy outcomes in patients treated only with chemotherapy. Those who conceived ≥one year after post-chemotherapy without radiation or ≥two years after chemotherapy with radiation displayed no elevated risks to pregnancy outcomes.<b>Fetal Risks From Ionizing Radiation</b>Significant potential harmful effects of ionizing radiation can be summarised into four main categories:While treating cancer in pregnant patients with radiotherapy, the goal is to improve the mother overall survival; however, specific considerations are vital to reduce the fetus's possible adverse implications. Earlier, the norm was to terminate the ongoing pregnancy, regardless of the trimesters. Fortunately, because of the advent of the latest developments of evidence and technology in the last two decades, we have steered away from this blanket policy. Since the 1990s, various technological and technical advancements in modern radiotherapies, such as 3D-conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and volumetric modulated arc therapy, have made it possible to give high doses to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy tissues or organs in the vicinity, hence improving radiotherapy in terms of effectiveness and tolerability. Furthermore, IMRT techniques using on-board cone-beam computed tomography have evolved to ensure a precise dose delivery. The detrimental principle of all radiation is that it should be ""as low as reasonably achievable"" (ALARA) as the effects of radiation are linearly cumulative. In practice, even though the fetus is excluded from the direct radiation field, the fetus gets radiation leaking from the accelerator and collimator dispersions. To cut down this radiation, we use lead blocks and shields to achieve ALARA.Childhood malignancy in the context of prenatal diagnostic and assessment X-ray was first reported by Giles et al. in 1956. Their survey of childhood cancers established that the risk increased linearly with the number of films exposed. The relative risk of developing a childhood cancer-associated was significantly higher if the exposure was during the first trimester, about 2.5 times greater than the third trimester. This study became the working model of various radiation-induced teratogenesis studies. A defining study was by Kato et al<i>.</i>, where they followed up the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs. It was the most extensive cohort study of intrauterine radiation exposure; interestingly, only 2 cases had childhood cancer before the 14th birthday out of 1630 children exposed without a single case of leukemia.Broadly, radiation effects are expressed as being either deterministic or stochastic.Ionizing radiation induces these effects by causing structural changes at the cellular and molecular levels. Non-ionizing radiation (which is not associated with medical imaging or radiotherapy) causes damage through heat transfer, such as microwave heating. Furthermore, by producing free radicals, ionizing radiation causes cellular damage by interfering with chemical bonds between molecules regulating critical cellular processes and events. This process generally leads to DNA mutation or cell death and sometimes causes damage to essential cellular enzymes. Susceptibility to radiation injury depends on the rate of cellular proliferation and differentiation of exposed tissues. Hence lymphoproliferative tissues with rapid cell turnover are the most susceptible, while nervous tissue with little or no cell turnover is the least affected."
0,Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation: A New Standard of Care?,32398982,2020/4/01,"<h3>Background</h3><p>Breast-conserving therapy including lumpectomy and adjuvant whole breast irradiation (WBI) has become the standard therapy for early-stage breast cancer (EBC). Without WBI, the recurrence rate is significantly increased. However, when selecting patients at a low a priori risk of local recurrence only a small breast-cancer-specific mortality benefit, but no overall survival improvement, was detected for WBI. As most recurrences occur close to the lumpectomy cavity, accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered exclusively to a limited volume of tissue around the initial lumpectomy site, has gained increased attention and is now discussed as an alternative to WBI for selected EBC patients.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>Numerous techniques for APBI (interstitial brachytherapy, external beam-based APBI, intraoperative radiotherapy, MR-guided radiotherapy) allow treatment delivery in a shorter period of time, and radiation oncologists expect to further reduce side effects by using these new techniques, with improvements in cosmetics and quality of life. In this review, we aim to describe the existing evidence for the feasibility and effectiveness of different APBI techniques used in modern radiotherapy.</p><h3>Key messages</h3><p>APBI has provided outcomes similar to WBI combined with potentially reduced toxicity. While appropriate patient selection persists to be crucial for acceptable recurrence rates, the precise definition of patients suitable for APBI remains a matter of discussion. As long-term data are often still lacking, special attention should be paid to late side effects and long-term outcomes. Decision-making on appropriate treatment techniques should take into account not only local control rates, but also the impact on the patient's quality of life.</p>"

0,Radiation Biomarkers: Can Small Businesses Drive Accurate Radiation Precision Medicine?,31910120,2020/3/01,"Radiation therapy is an essential component of cancer treatment. Currently, tumor control and normal tissue complication probabilities derived from a general patient population guide radiation treatment. Its outcome could be improved if radiation biomarkers could be incorporated into approaches to treatment. A substantial number of cancer patients suffer from side effects of radiation therapy. These side effects can result in treatment interruption. Such unplanned treatment interruptions not only jeopardize anticancer treatment efficacy but also result in poor post-treatment quality-of-life. To develop and translate radiation biomarkers for clinical use, NCI's Radiation Research Program, in collaboration with the Small Business Innovation Research Development Center, funded four small businesses through the request for proposals after peer review during 2015-2019. Here, we summarize publicly available information on intellectual property rights, the status of development, ongoing clinical trials, success in obtaining financing and regulatory approval. An analysis of publicly available information indicates all four companies have completed phase I of SBIR funding and advanced to further development, validation and clinical trials with phase II SBIR funding. These biomarkers are: 1. A panel of genomic biomarkers of radiation response to predict toxicity and radioimmune response (MiraDx Inc., Los Angeles, CA); 2. A multiplex assay for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) biomarkers of radiation sensitivity to identify a subset of prostate cancer patients for which radiotherapy is contraindicated (L2 Diagnostics, New Haven, CT); 3. A cell-free DNA assay in blood to measure tissue damage shortly after radiation exposure (DiaCarta Inc., Richmond, CA); and 4. A metabolomic/lipidomic assay to predict late effects that adversely affect quality-of-life among patients treated with radiation for prostate cancer (Shuttle Pharmaceuticals, Rockville, MD).

Recently, the combination of diffusion-weighted imaging and hepatospecific contrast media, such as gadoxetic acid in MRI, have been demonstrated to have the highest diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for detecting liver metastases. Various recent meta-analyses have confirmed the diagnostic superiority of this combination (diffusion-weighted imaging and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI), especially in terms of per lesion sensitivity, as compared with CT and <sup>18</sup>FDG-PET, even for smaller lesions (≤1 cm). However, none of the oncological guidelines have suggested the use of MRI as a first-line technique for liver metastasis detection during the staging process of oncological patients.

0,Target motion mitigation promotes high-precision treatment planning and delivery of extreme hypofractionated prostate cancer radiotherapy: Results from a phase II study,32087469,2020/5/01,"<h3>Background and purpose</h3><p>While favourable long-term outcomes have been reported in organ-confined prostate cancer treated with 5 × 7-8 Gy extreme hypofractionation, dose escalation to 5 × 9-10 Gy improved local control but was associated with unacceptable rates of late rectal and urinary toxicities. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility of intra-fractional prostate immobilization in reducing toxicity, to promote dose escalation with extreme hypofractionated radiotherapy in prostate cancer.</p><h3>Material and methods</h3><p>207 patients received 5 consecutive fractions of 9 Gy. An air-inflated (150 cm<sup>3</sup>) endorectal balloon and an intraurethral Foley catheter with 3 beacon transponders were used to immobilize the prostate and monitor intra-fractional target motion. VMAT-IGRT with inverse dose-painting was employed in delivering the PTV dose and in sculpting exposure of normal organs at risk to fulfil dose-volume constraints.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Introduction of air-filled balloon induced repeatable rectum/prostate complex migration from its resting position to a specific retropubic niche, affording the same 3D anatomical configuration daily. Intra-fractional target deviations ≤1 mm occurred in 95% of sessions, while target realignment in ≥2 mm deviations enabled treatment completion as scheduled.

The RBE was estimated with the microdosimetric kinetic (MK) model and measured linear energy transfer (LET) obtained with CR-39 plastic detectors.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A water phantom was irradiated by a <sup>12</sup> C pencil beam with energy of 380 MeV/u at the Gunma University Heavy Ion Medical Center (GHMC), and CR-39 detectors were exposed to secondary fragments. Because CR-39 was insensitive to low LET, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations with Geant4 to calculate low LET particles. The spectra of low LET particles were combined with experimental spectra to calculate RBE. To estimate accuracy of RBE, we calculated RBE by changing yield of low LET particles by ± 10% and ± 40%.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>At a small angle, maximum RBE by secondary fragments was 1.3 for 10% survival fractions. RBE values of fragments gradually decreased as the angle became larger. The shape of the LET spectra in the simulation reproduced the experimental spectra, but there was a discrepancy between the simulation and experiment for the relative yield of fragments. When the yield of low LET particles was changed by ± 40%, the change in RBE was smaller than 10%.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>An RBE of 1.3 was expected for secondary fragments emitted at a small angle. Although, we observed a discrepancy in the relative yield of secondary fragments between simulation and experiment, precision of RBE was not so sensitive to the yield of low LET particles.</p>"

0,"Conjugated polymer nano-systems for hyperthermia, imaging and drug delivery",32001326,2020/01/28,"Hyperthermia has shown tremendous therapeutic efficiency in the treatment of cancer due to its controllability, minimal invasiveness and limited side effects compared to the conventional treatment techniques like surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. To improve the precision of hyperthermia specifically to a tumor location, near infra-red (NIR) light activatable inorganic metal nanoparticles have served as effective photothermal therapy materials, but toxicity and non-biodegradability have limited their clinical applications. Conjugated polymer nanoparticles have overcome these limitations and are emerging as superior photothermal materials owing to their excellent light harvesting nature, biocompatibility and tunable absorption properties. In this review we focus on the development of organic conjugated polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polydopamine etc.) and their nanoparticles, which have broad NIR absorption. Such materials elicit photothermal effects upon NIR stimulation and may also serve as carriers for delivery of therapeutic and contrast agents for combined therapy. Subsequently, the emergence of donor-acceptor based semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with strong absorbance that is tunable across the NIR have been shown to eradicate tumors by either hyperthermia alone or combined with other therapies. The design of multifunctional polymer nanoparticles that absorb near- or mid- infrared light for heat generation, as well as their diagnostic abilities for precise biomedical applications are highlighted."

All patients were treated with involved-field radiotherapy (IF-RT) (24-30 Gy). From 2005, patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) after IF-RT received rituximab (R) (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> , 4 weekly administrations). The median follow-up is 82 months (17-196). At diagnosis, 72% of patients were BCL2/IGH+. Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly better in patients with undetectable/low levels (&lt;10<sup>-5</sup> ) of circulating BCL2/IGH+ cells at diagnosis and in those who were persistently MRD- during follow-up (P = 0·0038). IF-RT induced an MRD- status in 50% of cases; 16/19 (84%) MRD+ patients after IF-RT became MRD- after R treatment. A significantly longer PFS was observed in MRD+ patients treated with R compared to untreated MRD+ patients (P = 0·049). In early stage FL, both circulating levels of BCL2/IGH+ cells at diagnosis and MRD status during follow-up bear prognostic implications. Standard IF-RT fails to induce an MRD-negative status in half of patients. Most patients become MRD- following treatment with R and this is associated with a significantly better PFS."
0,A novel Approach for Non-Invasive Lung Imaging and Targeting Lung Immune Cells,32120819,2020/02/27,"Despite developments in pulmonary radiotherapy, radiation-induced lung toxicity remains a problem. More sensitive lung imaging able to increase the accuracy of diagnosis and radiotherapy may help reduce this problem. Super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles are used in imaging, but without further modification can cause unwanted toxicity and inflammation. Complex carbohydrate and polymer-based coatings have been used, but simpler compounds may provide additional benefits. Herein, we designed and generated super-paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles coated with the neutral natural dietary amino acid glycine (GSPIONs), to support non-invasive lung imaging and determined particle biodistribution, as well as understanding the impact of the interaction of these nanoparticles with lung immune cells. These GSPIONs were characterized to be crystalline, colloidally stable, with a size of 12 ± 5 nm and a hydrodynamic diameter of 84.19 ± 18 nm. Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen (CHN) elemental analysis estimated approximately 20.2 × 10<sup>3</sup> glycine molecules present per nanoparticle. We demonstrated that it is possible to determine the biodistribution of the GSPIONs in the lung using three-dimensional (3D) ultra-short echo time magnetic resonance imaging. The GSPIONs were found to be taken up selectively by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the lung. In addition, the GSPIONs did not cause changes to airway resistance or induce inflammatory cytokines. Alveolar macrophages and neutrophils are critical regulators of pulmonary inflammatory diseases, including allergies, infections, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Therefore, pulmonary Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging and preferential targeting of these lung resident cells by our nanoparticles offer precise imaging tools, which can be utilized to develop precision targeted radiotherapy as well as diagnostic tools for lung cancer, thereby having the potential to reduce the pulmonary complications of radiation."

Radiation therapy has long played a key role in the management of both local and metastatic melanoma. Although local radiation therapy exerts antitumor effects by damaging the cellular DNA, it also induces an important out-of-field (distant) effect known as the ""abscopal effect"" in nonirradiated sites. Radiation therapy-induced abscopal effects are believed to be mediated by activation and stimulation of the immune system.</p><h3>Objective</h3><p>To provide a detailed overview of the current state of knowledge and clinical experience of radiation therapy-induced abscopal effects in patients with malignant melanoma.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Using electronic databases such as MEDLINE via PubMed and Google Scholar, a systematic literature review was performed to find published clinical evidence for radiation therapy-induced abscopal effects in patients with malignant melanoma. The clinical data on radiation therapy-induced abscopal effects were reviewed and the outcomes summarized.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Clinical evidence of patients with malignant melanoma was gathered using databases from MEDLINE and those findings were summarized. Although the precise mechanism of the abscopal effect of radiation therapy is still not completely understood, evidence suggests that tumor cell destruction by radiation releases tumor antigens that stimulate the immune system of the host to activate the body's immune effector cells systemically and produce distant non-target antitumor effects. This forms a basis for using the radiation therapy with immunotherapy to augment the abscopal response rates.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Current clinical evidence suggests that there is a large potential to enhance the abscopal effect when radiation therapy is combined with immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of malignant melanoma. Ongoing and planned clinical trials may provide us with a more in-depth understanding of how this combination therapy can be optimally utilized clinically to achieve improved survival outcomes among patients with malignant melanoma.</p>"

A third smaller randomized study examined the question of the optimal frequency of treatments. The results of these studies will be reviewed. SABR for high risk prostate cancer has been shown to be feasible and is well tolerated with careful planning and setup techniques. However, there is currently insufficient data supporting its use for high-risk patients to offer SABR outside of a clinical trial. SABR costs less to the radiotherapydepartments and, the patient, as well as increasing system capacity. Therefore, it has the potential to be widely adopted in the next few years."

We developed a novel hybrid deep learning model to efficiently integrate an entire set of dosimetric parameters of a radiation treatment plan with a patient's pre- and mid-treatment information to improve the prediction of grade 4 radiotherapy-induced lymphopenia. We proposed a two-input channel hybrid deep learning model to process dosimetric information using a stacked bi-directional long-short term memory structure and non-dosimetric information using a multilayer perceptron structure independently before integrating the dosimetric and non-dosimetric information for final prediction. The model was trained from 505 patients and tested in 216 patients. We compared our model with other popular predictive models, including logistic regression (with and without elastic-net regularization) random forest, support vector machines, and artificial neural network. Our hybrid deep learning model out-performed other predictive models in various evaluation metrics. It achieved the highest area under the curve at 0.831, accuracy at 0.769, F1 score at 0.631, precision at 0.670, and recall at 0.610. The hybrid deep learning model also demonstrated robustness in exploiting the value of dosimetric parameters in predictive modeling. We demonstrated that our hybrid deep learning model with a two-input channel structure, which addressed the sequential and inter-correlated nature of dosimetric parameters, could potentially improve the prediction of radiotherapy-induced lymphopenia. Our proposed deep learning framework is flexible and transferable to other related radiotherapy-induced toxicities."
0,The impact of respiratory gating on improving volume measurement of murine lung tumors in micro-CT imaging,32097413,2020/02/25,"Small animal imaging has become essential in evaluating new cancer therapies as they are translated from the preclinical to clinical domain. However, preclinical imaging faces unique challenges that emphasize the gap between mouse and man. One example is the difference in breathing patterns and breath-holding ability, which can dramatically affect tumor burden assessment in lung tissue. As part of a co-clinical trial studying immunotherapy and radiotherapy in sarcomas, we are using micro-CT of the lungs to detect and measure metastases as a metric of disease progression. To effectively utilize metastatic disease detection as a metric of progression, we have addressed the impact of respiratory gating during micro-CT acquisition on improving lung tumor detection and volume quantitation. Accuracy and precision of lung tumor measurements with and without respiratory gating were studied by performing experiments with in vivo images, simulations, and a pocket phantom. When performing test-retest studies in vivo, the variance in volume calculations was 5.9% in gated images and 15.8% in non-gated images, compared to 2.9% in post-mortem images. Sensitivity of detection was examined in images with simulated tumors, demonstrating that reliable sensitivity (true positive rate (TPR) ≥ 90%) was achievable down to 1.0 mm3 lesions with respiratory gating, but was limited to ≥ 8.0 mm3 in non-gated images. Finally, a clinically-inspired ""pocket phantom"" was used during in vivo mouse scanning to aid in refining and assessing the gating protocols. Application of respiratory gating techniques reduced variance of repeated volume measurements and significantly improved the accuracy of tumor volume quantitation in vivo."

In addition, radiotherapy (RT) process may be difficult in these cases and often result in more toxicity.</p><h3>Case presentation</h3><p>In this case report, we present a 77-year-old woman with a diagnosis of primary vaginal cancer associated with POP, who was treated with definitive CRT using a pessary to restore vaginal anatomy for optimal radiation. Following CRT, complete response was observed and vaginal cuff BT was performed. The patient tolerated the treatment very well and is still alive without disease at 10-months follow-up.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Combined primary vaginal cancer and POP is an extremely rare clinical entity, with only a few cases reported in the literature. When applying CRT in these cases, critical organ doses may be higher than expected due to the downward descent of the pelvic organs. Especially in elderly patients, a pessary can be used as a non-surgical procedure to restore the anatomy for symptom relief during definitive CRT. Additionally, it allows tumors to be targeted more precisely.</p>"
0,A deep learning approach to radiation dose estimation,31881547,2020/02/04,"Currently methods for predicting absorbed dose after administering a radiopharmaceutical are rather crude in daily clinical practice. Most importantly, individual tissue density distributions as well as local variations of the concentration of the radiopharmaceutical are commonly neglected. The current study proposes machine learning techniques like Green's function-based empirical mode decomposition and deep learning methods on U-net architectures in conjunction with soft tissue kernel Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to overcome current limitations in precision and reliability of dose estimations for clinical dosimetric applications. We present a hybrid method (DNN-EMD) based on deep neural networks (DNN) in combination with empirical mode decomposition (EMD) techniques. The algorithm receives x-ray computed tomography (CT) tissue density maps and dose maps, estimated according to the MIRD protocol, i.e. employing whole organ S-values and related time-integrated activities (TIAs), and from measured SPECT distributions of <sup>177</sup>Lu radionuclei, and learns to predict individual absorbed dose distributions. In a second step, density maps are replaced by their intrinsic modes as deduced from an EMD analysis. The system is trained using individual full MC simulation results as reference. Data from a patient cohort of 26 subjects are reported in this study. The proposed methods were validated employing a leave-one-out cross-validation technique. Deviations of estimated dose from corresponding MC results corroborate a superior performance of the newly proposed hybrid DNN-EMD method compared to its related MIRD DVK dose calculation. Not only are the mean deviations much smaller with the new method, but also the related variances are much reduced. If intrinsic modes of the tissue density maps are input to the algorithm, variances become even further reduced though the mean deviations are less affected. The newly proposed hybrid DNN-EMD method for individualized radiation dose prediction outperforms the MIRD DVK dose calculation method. It is fast enough to be of use in daily clinical practice."

0,Real-time 4DMRI-based internal target volume definition for moving lung tumors,31955430,2020/4/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>In photon radiotherapy, respiratory-induced target motion can be accounted for by internal target volumes (ITV) or mid-ventilation target volumes (midV) defined on the basis of four-dimensional computed tomography (4D-CT). Intrinsic limitations of these approaches can result in target volumes that are not representative for the gross tumor volume (GTV) motion over the course of treatment. To address these limitations, we propose a novel patient-specific ITV definition method based on real-time 4D magnetic resonance imaging (rt-4DMRI).</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Three lung cancer patients underwent weekly rt-4DMRI scans. A total of 24 datasets were included in this retrospective study. The GTV was contoured on breath-hold MR images and propagated to all rt-4DMRI images by deformable image registration.

0,Treatment outcome of anaplastic ependymoma under the age of 3 treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy,32229806,2020/3/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) allows for more precise treatment, reducing unwanted radiation to nearby structures. We investigated the safety and feasibility of IMRT for anaplastic ependymoma patients below 3 years of age.</p><h3>Materials and methods</h3><p>A total of 9 anaplastic ependymoma patients below 3 years of age, who received IMRT between October 2011 and December 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. The median equivalent dose in 2 Gy fractions was 52.0 Gy (range, 48.0 to 60.0 Gy). Treatment outcomes and neurologic morbidities were reviewed in detail.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The median patient age was 20.9 months (range, 12.1 to 31.2 months). All patients underwent surgery. The rates of 5-year overall survival, freedom from local recurrence, and progression-free survival were 40.6%, 53.3%, and 26.7%, respectively. Of the 9 patients, 5 experienced recurrences (3 had local recurrence, 1 had both local recurrence and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] seeding, and 1 had CSF seeding alone). Five patients died because of disease progression. Assessment of neurologic morbidity revealed motor dysfunction in 3 patients, all of whom presented with hydrocephalus at initial diagnosis because of the location of the tumor and already had neurologic deficits before radiotherapy (RT).</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Neurologic morbidity is not caused by RT alone but may result from mass effects of the tumor and surgical sequelae. Administration of IMRT to anaplastic ependymoma patients below 3 years of age yielded encouraging local control and tolerable morbidities. High-precision modern RT such as IMRT can be considered for very young patients with anaplastic ependymoma.</p>"

This is expected to optimise measurement precision, relevance to patients and flexibility. Here, we present the first international validation of the EORTC CAT Core.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A heterogeneous sample of 699 cancer patients scheduled for chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy was recruited across seven European countries. The EORTC CAT Core and all QLQ-C30 items were administered to participants before and after initiating treatment. Correlations between CAT and QLQ-C30 scores and floor/ceiling effects were calculated. Using several grouping variables, relative validity (cross-sectional known groups difference), responsiveness (changes over time) and relative sample size requirements of the CAT compared to the QLQ-C30 were estimated.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Correlations of the CAT and QLQ-C30 ranged from 0.81 to 0.93 across domains. The mean relative reduction in floor and ceiling effects using the CAT was 42% (range 3-99%). Analyses of known groups validity and responsiveness indicated that, across domains, mean sample size requirements for the CAT were 72% and 70%, respectively, of those using the QLQ-C30.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>The EORTC CAT Core measures the same domains as the QLQ-C30 with reduced floor/ceiling effects. The CAT generally facilitated the use of smaller samples (about 30% smaller on average) without loss of power compared to the QLQ-C30. Based on this study, the EORTC QLG will release the EORTC CAT Core for general use.</p>"

They usually have been used for diagnosis, but when combining with radiotherapy, PET and SPECT images would be helpful to make a decision on radiation-dose distribution for treatment because the patient images can be obtained in the similar condition under radiation therapy. In addition, anti-tumor effect of radiation therapy is now precisely controlled for target. Therefore, precise information of tumor, such as extent of tumor and heterogeneity within tumor, would make the treatment more effective, while normal organ functions are preserved. What nuclear medicine can do for the ideal treatment is discussed in this section."
0,Precise prediction of the radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer: an explorative preliminary mathematical model using genotype information,32127959,2020/02/10,"<b>Purpose</b>: Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is the most significant dose-limiting toxicity and is one major obstacle for lung cancer radiotherapy. Grade ≥2 RP usually needs clinical interventions and serve RP could be life threatening. Clinically, tissue response could be strikingly different even two similar patients after identical radiotherapy. Previous methods for the RP prediction can hardly distinguish substantial variations among individuals. Reliable predictive factors or methods emphasizing the individual differences are strongly desired by clinical radiation oncologists. The purpose of this study is to develop an approach for the personalized RP risk prediction. <b>Experimental Design</b>: One hundred eighteen lung cancer patients who received radiotherapy were enrolled. Seven hundred thousand single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites were assessed via Generalized Linear Models via Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularization (GLMNET) to determine their synergistic effects on the RP risk prediction. Non-genetic factors including patient's phenotypes and clinical interventional parameters were separately assessed by statistic test. Based on the results of the aforementioned analysis, a multiple linear regression model named Radiation Pneumonitis Index (RPI) was built, for the assessment of Grade ≥2RP risk. <b>Results</b>: Only previous surgery and fractional dose were discovered statistical significantly associated with grade ≥2RP. Thirty-nine effective SNPs for predicting the Grade ≥2RP risk were discovered and their coefficients of the synergistic effect were determined. The RPI score can successfully distinguish the RP≥2 population with 92.0% sensitivity and 100% specificity. <b>Conclusions</b>: Individual radiation sensitivity can be determined with genotype information and personalized radiotherapy could be achieved based on mathematical model result."
0,Primary Cutaneous Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma (pcALCL) in the Elderly and the Importance of Sport Activity Training,32013101,2020/01/29,"Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) is part of a spectrum of cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disease that also includes lymphomatoid papulosis. It often occurs in elderly patients, presenting at a median age of 60 years, although it may occur at any age. It is a CD30+ T-cell neoplasm composed of large cells with anaplastic, pleomorphic, or immunoblastic morphology, with exclusively cutaneous onset and localization. The clinical course of pcALCL is predominantly indolent. Most elderly patients with lymphoma tend to have a sedentary lifestyle, which has a negative effect on their quality of life (QoL) and survival. Several studies indicate that exercise has a positive impact on QoL because it reduces peak oxygen consumption, improves physical capacity, increases self-esteem, reduces accumulated stress, and promotes relaxation. Therefore, particularly in indolent lymphomas, it is necessary to indicate a program of physical activity to be practiced systematically. Complete surgical excision and local radiotherapy are the first line gold standard in pcALCL with a solitary lesion."

0,Dual pH-triggered catalytic selective Mn clusters for cancer radiosensitization and radioprotection,31793608,2020/01/02,"Hypoxia is known to be a common feature within many types of solid tumors, which is closely related to the limited efficacy of radiotherapy. Meanwhile, due to the non-discriminatory killing effect of both normal and cancer cells during the radiation process, traditional radiosensitizers could bring severe non-negligible side-effects to the whole body. In this work, stable and atomically precise Mn clusters which possess efficient pH-triggered catalytic selective capacity are developed rationally. Mn clusters could efficiently catalyze oxygen production in an acidic tumor microenvironment, while exhibiting strong reducibility and free radical scavenging ability in neutral circumstances. In vivo experiments show that Mn clusters are able to enhance the radiotherapy effect in the mouse model of 4T1 tumors and protect normal tissues from radiation at the same time. Thus, the present work provides a novel dual-functional strategy to enhance radiotherapy-induced tumor treatment by improving tumor oxygenation and protect normal tissues from radiation simultaneously."

Herein, we reported a case series of elderly patients with previous lymphoma undergoing endoscopic treatment followed by pulmonary rehabilitation for lung abscess. <i>Methods</i>: Our study population included a consecutive series of elderly patients with previous lymphoma and lung abscess. Suppurative infection was refractory with specific antibiotic therapy. In all cases, drainage was endoscopically inserted in lung abscess via video-bronchoscopy. This strategy allowed performing daily therapy with the installation of gentamicin directly into the abscess cavity. All patients underwent a respiratory rehabilitation program to speed up convalescence and allow early discharge. <i>Results</i>: After positioning the catheter through a bronchoscopic route and subsequent washing with gentamicin, all the patients in our study showed an improvement in clinical conditions with resolution of fever within a few days of starting the procedure with normalization of blood tests (mean hospital length 7 ± 0.73 days).

Testicular germ cell tumors are the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and surgical removal of the testes is often a radical necessity along with chemotherapy and radiotherapy. While seminomas are receptive to radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy, non-seminomatous germ cell tumors respond to chemotherapy only. Due to the singular nature of testicular cancers with associated orchiectomy and mortality, it is important to study the molecular basis and genetic underpinnings of this group of cancers across male populations globally. In this review, we shed light on the population pharmacogenetics of testicular cancer, pediatric and adult tumors, current clinical trials, genetic determinants of chemotherapy-induced toxicity in testicular cancer, as well as the molecular signal transduction pathways operating in this malignancy.

Analysis using currently available NGS genomic tests is conducted on cancer-derived DNA collected from tumor tissue, blood, or both. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) produces a detectable somatic clonal mutation that is commonly associated with clonal expansion of hematopoietic cells with age and genomic analysis of blood samples can be used to detect CH. A 74-year-old Korean male had lung adenocarcinoma with a metastasis to the left scapula. He underwent palliative radiotherapy to the left scapula and received multi-line chemotherapies. After disease progression, he underwent re-biopsy of the metastatic tumor tissue from lung cancer and concomitant blood sampling. NGS genomic testing revealed no significant genomic mutation in the tumor tissue DNA but showed the <i>TP53</i> mutation C135Y in peripheral blood DNA. To investigate the discordance between the genotyping results in tumor tissue and blood, we tested for the <i>TP53</i> mutation using a target sequencing test in blood and normal oral mucosa. The <i>TP53</i> mutation C135Y was only detected in the blood sample, confirming the presence of <i>TP53</i>-mutated CH. We should be aware of different characteristics in NGS genomic testing including sample type such as tumor, blood, or paired specimens. Performing genomic testing on paired tumor and blood samples is effective for discriminating mutations derived from CH from germline mutations and somatic mutations in tumor cells."

The subjective evaluation showed that DLC contours were more often preferable to the ABAS contours overall, were considered to be more precise, and more often confused with manual contours. Manual contours still outperformed both DLC and ABAS; however, DLC results were within or bordering the inter-observer variability for the manual edited contours in this cohort.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The DLC, trained on a large HN cancer patient cohort, outperformed the ABAS for the majority of HN OARs.</p>"
0,Radiobiological models in prediction of radiation cardiotoxicity,31889920,2020/01/01,"Coronary disease induced by previous radiotherapy is the most common cause of death among patients treated with radiotherapy for cancer. Risk factors that may affect the frequency and intensity of radiotherapy's cardiac toxicity are primarily the radiation dose and the volume of the heart exposed to radiation. The prolonged survival time of patients after radiotherapy, but also the intensive development of modern radiotherapy techniques results in the necessity of precise estimation of both tumor control probability, and the risk of normal tissue damage, thus the models describing the probability of complications in normal tissues have also been developed. The response from the cardiovascular system to high-dose radiation is known and associated with a pro-inflammatory response. However, the effect of low doses may be completely different because it induces an anti-inflammatory response. Also, there is no unambiguous answer to the question of whether RICD is a deterministic effect. Moreover, there is a lack of literature data on the use of known radiobiological models to assess the risk of cardiovascular complications. The models described are general and concerns any healthy tissue. Therefore, when planning treatment for patients, particular attention should be paid to the dose and area of ​​the heart to be irradiated."

A dosimetric and biological verification of CICR<sub>C-p</sub> treatments using a murine glioma cell line (GL261) was performed.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>CICR treatment plans for the 3 patients presented highly uniform physical dose while reducing high dose-averaged linear energy transfer gradients compared with carbon ions alone. When considering uncertainty in tissue parameter (α/β)<sub>x</sub> assignment and RBE modeling, the CICR<sub>C-p</sub> treatment exhibited enhanced biophysical stability within the target volume, similar to protons alone. CICR treatments reduced dose to normal tissue surrounding the target, exhibiting similar or improved dosimetric features compared with SFUD<sub>He</sub>. For both CICR<sub>C-p</sub> and SFUD treatments, measurements verified the planned dose in the target within ∼3%. Planned versus measured target RBE values were 1.38 ± 0.02 and 1.39 ± 0.07 (&lt;1% deviation), respectively, for the CICR<sub>C-p</sub> treatment in heterogenous settings.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Here, we demonstrate that by combining 2 (or more) ions in a single field arrangement, more robust biological and more conformal dose distributions can be delivered compared with conventional particle therapy treatment planning.

0,Fine-mapping of 150 breast cancer risk regions identifies 191 likely target genes,31911677,2020/1/01,"Genome-wide association studies have identified breast cancer risk variants in over 150 genomic regions, but the mechanisms underlying risk remain largely unknown. These regions were explored by combining association analysis with in silico genomic feature annotations. We defined 205 independent risk-associated signals with the set of credible causal variants in each one. In parallel, we used a Bayesian approach (PAINTOR) that combines genetic association, linkage disequilibrium and enriched genomic features to determine variants with high posterior probabilities of being causal. Potentially causal variants were significantly over-represented in active gene regulatory regions and transcription factor binding sites. We applied our INQUSIT pipeline for prioritizing genes as targets of those potentially causal variants, using gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci), chromatin interaction and functional annotations. Known cancer drivers, transcription factors and genes in the developmental, apoptosis, immune system and DNA integrity checkpoint gene ontology pathways were over-represented among the highest-confidence target genes."

We assessed whether circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) might be an early indicator of tumor response or progression to guide therapy adaptation in rectal cancer.</p><h3>Experimental design</h3><p>A total of 243 serial plasma samples were analyzed from 47 patients with localized rectal cancer undergoing CRT. Up to three somatic variants were tracked in plasma using droplet digital PCR. RECIST and MRI tumor regression grade (mrTRG) evaluated response. Survival analyses applied Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>ctDNA detection rates were: 74% (<i>n</i> = 35/47) pretreatment, 21% (<i>n</i> = 10/47) mid CRT, 21% (<i>n</i> = 10/47) after completing CRT, and 13% (<i>n</i> = 3/23) after surgery. ctDNA status after CRT was associated with primary tumor response by mrTRG (<i>P</i> = 0.03). With a median follow-up of 26.4 months, metastases-free survival was shorter in patients with detectable ctDNA after completing CRT [HR 7.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4-21.5; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001], persistently detectable ctDNA pre and mid CRT (HR 3.8; 95% CI, 1.2-11.7; <i>P</i> = 0.02), and pre, mid, and after CRT (HR 11.5; 95% CI, 3.3-40.4; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) compared with patients with undetectable or nonpersistent ctDNA. In patients with detectable ctDNA, a fractional abundance threshold of ≥0.07% mid CRT or ≥0.13% after completing CRT predicted for metastases with 100% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity for mid CRT and 66.7% for CRT completion.

0,Performance comparison of prediction filters for respiratory motion tracking in radiotherapy,31738453,2020/2/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>In precision radiotherapy, the intrafractional motion causes substantial uncertainty. Traditionally, the target volume is expanded to cover the tumor in all positions. Alternative approaches are gating and adaptive tracking, which require a time delay as small as possible between the actual tumor motion and the reaction to effectively compensate the motion. Current treatment machines often exhibit large time delays. Prediction filters offer a promising means to mitigate these time delays by predicting the future respiratory motion.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A total of 18 prediction filters were implemented and their hyperparameters optimized for various time delays and noise levels. A set of 93 traces were standardized to a sampling frequency of 25 Hz and smoothed using the Fourier transform with a 3 Hz cutoff frequency. The hyperparameter optimization was carried out with ten traces, and the optimal hyperparameters were evaluated on the remaining 83 traces.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>For smooth traces, the wavelet least mean squares prediction filter and the linear filter reached normalized root mean square errors of below 0.05 for time delays of 160 and 480 ms, respectively. For noisy signals, the performance of the prediction filters deteriorated and led to similar results.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Linear methods for prediction filters are sufficient for respiratory motion signals. Reducing the measurement noise generally improves the performance of the prediction filters investigated in this study, even during breathing irregularities.</p>"
0,Stereotactic body radiotherapy for ventricular tachycardia (cardiac radiosurgery) : First-in-patient treatment in Germany,31673718,2020/1/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>Single-session cardiac stereotactic body radiotherapy, called cardiac radiosurgery (CRS) or radioablation (RA), may offer a potential treatment option for patients with refractory ventricular tachycardia (VT) and electrical storm who are otherwise ineligible for catheter ablation. However, there is only limited clinical experience. We now present the first-in-patient treatment using (CRS/RA) for VT in Germany.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A 78-year-old male patient with dilated cardiomyopathy and significantly reduced ejection fraction (15%) presented with monomorphic VT refractory to poly-anti-arrhythmic medication and causing multiple implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) interventions over the course of several weeks, necessitating prolonged treatment on an intensive care unit. Ultra-high-resolution electroanatomical voltage mapping (EVM) revealed a re-entry circuit in the cardiac septum inaccessible for catheter ablation. Based on the EVM, CRS/RA with a single session dose of 25 Gy (83% isodose) was delivered to the VT substrate (8.1 cc) using a c-arm-based high-precision linear accelerator on November 30, 2018.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>CRS/RA was performed without incident and dysfunction of the ICD was not observed. Following the procedure, a significant reduction in monomorphic VT from 5.0 to 1.6 episodes per week and of ICD shock interventions by 81.2% was observed. Besides periprocedural nausea with a single episode of vomiting, no treatment-associated side effects were noted. Unfortunately, the patient died 57 days after CRS/RA due to sepsis-associated cardiac circulatory failure after Clostridium difficile-associated colitis developed during rehabilitation. Histopathologic examination of the heart as part of a clinical autopsy revealed diffuse fibrosis on most sections of the heart without apparent differences between the target area and the posterior cardiac wall serving as a control.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>CRS/RA appears to be a possible treatment option for otherwise untreatable patients suffering from refractory VT and electrical storm. A relevant reduction in VT incidence and ICD interventions was observed, although long-term outcome and consequences of CRS/RA remain unclear. Clinical trials are strongly warranted and have been initiated.</p>"

We sought to quantify orbital asymmetry in ERMS survivors and characterize the dose effect of radiation to the orbital bones.</p><h3>Methods and materials</h3><p>We evaluated the most recent follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 17 children (≤21 years old) with stage 1 group III orbital ERMS treated with proton therapy between 2007 and 2018. For all patients, the orbital socket volumes were calculated and compared with the contralateral, unirradiated orbital socket. Patient age, orbital tumor quadrant, and the radiation dose delivered to the major orbital bones (maxillary, frontal, and zygomatic bones) were recorded and correlated with the orbital socket volume difference.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The mean age at diagnosis was 5.4 years old (range, 1.1-9.7 years). All patients received a prescription dose of 45 GyRBE. The mean time interval between radiation and MRI was 2.9 years (range, 0.8-3.2 years). The mean age at most recent MRI was 8.4 years (range, 2.3-12.9 years). In 16 of 17 patients, the volume of the ipsilateral orbit was significantly smaller than the contralateral orbit on follow-up MRI (P ≤ .0001). In one patient with nonviable tumor in situ, the irradiated orbit was larger. The volume difference increased with follow-up time and did not correlate with age at treatment or age at MRI. A dose &gt;40 GyRBE to all bones of the orbital rim was associated with a significant decrease in orbital volume (P &lt; .05), but an isolated dose of &gt;40 GyRBE to either the frontal, maxillary, or zygomatic bone was not.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Despite the dosimetric precision of proton therapy, orbital asymmetry will develop after &gt;40 GyRBE to multiple bones of the orbital rim.

0,FBXW7 Confers Radiation Survival by Targeting p53 for Degradation,31940492,2020/01/14,"The tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in integrating a wide variety of stress responses. Therefore, p53 levels are precisely regulated by multiple ubiquitin ligases. In this study, we report that FBXW7, a substrate recognition component of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ligase, interacts with and targets p53 for polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation after exposure to ionizing radiation or etoposide. Mechanistically, DNA damage activates ATM to phosphorylate p53 on Ser33 and Ser37, which facilitates the FBXW7 binding and subsequent p53 degradation by SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup>. Inactivation of ATM or SCF<sup>FBXW7</sup> by small molecular inhibitors or genetic knockdown/knockout approaches extends the p53 protein half-life upon DNA damage in an MDM2-independent manner. Biologically, FBXW7 inactivation sensitizes cancer cells to radiation or etoposide by stabilizing p53 to induce cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Taken together, our study elucidates a mechanism by which FBXW7 confers cancer cell survival during radiotherapy or chemotherapy via p53 targeting."
0,Radiomics predicts survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer undergoing PD-1 blockade using Nivolumab,31966081,2020/2/01,"Immune checkpoint blockade is an emerging anticancer strategy, and Nivolumab is a human mAb to PD-1 that is used in the treatment of a number of different malignancies, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), kidney cancer, urothelial carcinoma and melanoma. Although the use of Nivolumab prolongs survival in a number of patients, this treatment is hampered by high cost. Therefore, the identification of predictive markers of response to treatment in patients is required. In this context, PD-1/PDL1 blockade antitumor effects occur through the reactivation of a pre-existing immune response, and the efficacy of these effects is strictly associated with the presence of necrosis, hypoxia and inflammation at the tumour sites. It has been indicated that these events can be evaluated by specific assessments using a computed tomography (CT) texture analysis (TA) or radiomics. Therefore, a retrospective study was performed, which aimed to evaluate the potential use of this analysis in the identification of patients with NSCLC who may benefit from Nivolumab treatment. A retrospective analysis was performed of 59 patients with metastatic NSCLC who received Nivolumab treatment between January 2015 and July 2017 at Siena University Hospital (35 patients, training dataset), Catanzaro University Hospital and Reggio Calabria Grand Metropolitan Hospital, Italy (24 patients, validation dataset). Pre- and post-contrast CT sequences were used to contour the gross tumour volume (GTV) of the target lesions prior to Nivolumab treatment. The impact of variations on contouring was analysed using two delineations, which were performed on each patient, and the TA parameters were tested for reliability using the Intraclass Coefficient Correlation method (ICC). All analyses for the current study were performed using LifeX Software<sup>©</sup>. Imaging, clinical and pathological parameters were correlated with progression free survival and overall survival (OS) using Kaplan Meier analysis. An external validation testing was performed for the TA Score using the validation dataset. A total of 59 patients were included in the analysis of the present study. The reliability ICC analysis of 14 TA parameters indicated a highly reproducibility (ICC &gt;0.70, single measure) in 12 (85%) pre- contrast and 13 (93%) post-contrast exams. A specific cut-off was detected for each of the following parameters: volume (score 1 &gt;36 ml), histogram entropy (score 1 &gt; 1.30), compacity (score 1 &lt;3), gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-entropy (score 1 &gt;1.80), GLCM-Dissimilarity (score 1 &gt;5) and GLCM-Correlation (score 1&lt;0.54). The global texture score allowed the classification of two subgroups of Low (Score 0-1; 36 patients; 61%) and High Risk patients (Score &gt;1; 23 patients; 39%) that respectively, showed a median OS of 26 (mean +/- SD: 18 +/- 1.98 months; 95% CI 14-21 months) and 5 months (mean +/- SD: 6 +/- 0.99 months; 95% CI: 4-8 months; P=0.002). The current study indicated that TA parameters can identify patients that will benefit from PD-1 blockage by defining the radiological settings that are potentially suggestive of an active immune response. These results require further confirmation in prospective trials."

0,Precision Chemoradiotherapy for HER2 Tumors Using Antibody Conjugates of an Auristatin Derivative with Reduced Cell Permeability,31597712,2020/1/01,"The most successful therapeutic strategies for locally advanced cancers continue to combine decades-old classical radiosensitizing chemotherapies with radiotherapy. Molecular targeted radiosensitizers offer the potential to improve the therapeutic ratio by increasing tumor-specific kill while minimizing drug delivery and toxicity to surrounding normal tissue. Auristatins are a potent class of anti-tubulins that sensitize cells to ionizing radiation damage and are chemically amenable to antibody conjugation. To achieve tumor-selective radiosensitization, we synthesized and tested anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates of two auristatin derivatives with ionizing radiation. Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) and monomethyl auristatin F (MMAF) were attached to the anti-HER2 antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab through a cleavable linker. While MMAE is cell permeable, MMAF has limited cell permeability as free drug resulting in diminished cytotoxicity and radiosensitization. However, when attached to trastuzumab or pertuzumab, MMAF was as efficacious as MMAE in blocking HER2-expressing tumor cells in G<sub>2</sub>-M. Moreover, MMAF anti-HER2 conjugates selectively killed and radiosensitized HER2-rich tumor cells. Importantly, when conjugated to targeting antibody, MMAF had the advantage of decreased bystander and off-target effects compared with MMAE. In murine xenograft models, MMAF anti-HER2 antibody conjugates had less drug accumulated in the normal tissue surrounding tumors compared with MMAE. Therapeutically, systemically injected MMAF anti-HER2 conjugates combined with focal ionizing radiation increased tumor control and improved survival of mice with HER2-rich tumor xenografts. In summary, our results demonstrate the potential of cell-impermeable radiosensitizing warheads to improve the therapeutic ratio of radiotherapy by leveraging antibody-drug conjugate technology."
0,Response to Preoperative Radiation Therapy in Relation to Gene Expression Patterns in Breast Cancer Patients,31525407,2020/01/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>We aimed to study radiation-induced gene expression changes and to identify differences in gene expression between patients with and without response to radiation therapy (RT) for invasive breast cancer with the purpose of exploring whether a predictive signature could be developed. Such a signature could assist in optimizing individualized locoregional treatment.</p><h3>Methods and materials</h3><p>RNA-seq using next-generation sequencing was performed on fresh frozen samples from pretreatment biopsies and post-RT surgery specimens from patients with low-risk breast cancer treated within the multicenter preoperative accelerated partial breast irradiation trial. Patients were treated with preoperative RT (10 × 4 Gy in 10 days or 5 × 6 Gy in 5 days) and a lumpectomy 6 weeks thereafter. The response of the tumor to RT was evaluated by pathologic assessment. To analyze the gene expression data, unsupervised and supervised clustering was performed. Gene expression profiles were compared between biopsies of responders and nonresponders and between samples before and after RT.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Ninety-four samples from 77 patients were analyzed: 68 pretreatment biopsies and 26 post-RT surgery specimens. Six patients had a (near) complete pathologic response, 3 patients had a good response, 32 patients had a partial response, and 22 patients had no or very limited response. Comparing patients with and without response to RT, 25 genes were significantly differentially expressed and were not linked to a pathway. Comparison of samples before and after RT identified significant changes in gene expression. Genes involved in p53 signaling, TNFA1 signaling, apoptosis, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and inflammatory response were upregulated. Genes involved in mitotic spindle, G2M checkpoint, and E2F targets were downregulated.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Radiation-induced gene expression changes mainly involved p53 signaling, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and inflammatory response. No clinically significant differences could be identified in gene expression between patients with and without response to RT.</p>"
0,Tumor regression during radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer patients using cone-beam computed tomography images,31559481,2020/2/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>Previous literature has reported contradicting results regarding the relationship between tumor volume changes during radiotherapy treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and locoregional recurrence-free rate or overall survival. The aim of this study is to validate the results from a previous study by using a different volume extraction procedure and evaluating an external validation dataset.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>For two datasets of 94 and 141 NSCLC patients, gross tumor volumes were determined manually to investigate the relationship between tumor volume regression and locoregional control using Kaplan-Meier curves. For both datasets, different subgroups of patients based on histology and chemotherapy regimens were also investigated. For the first dataset (n = 94), automatically determined tumor volumes were available from a previously published study to further compare their correlation with updated clinical data.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>A total of 70 out of 94 patients were classified into the same group as in the previous publication, splitting the dataset based on median tumor regression calculated by the two volume extraction methods. Non-adenocarcinoma patients receiving concurrent chemotherapy with large tumor regression show reduced locoregional recurrence-free rates in both datasets (p &lt; 0.05 in dataset 2). For dataset 2, the opposite behavior is observed for patients not receiving chemotherapy, which was significant for overall survival (p = 0.01) but non-significant for locoregional recurrence-free rate (p = 0.13).</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The tumor regression pattern observed during radiotherapy is not only influenced by irradiation but depends largely on the delivered chemotherapy schedule, so it follows that the relationship between patient outcome and the degree of tumor regression is also largely determined by the chemotherapy schedule. This analysis shows that the relationship between tumor regression and outcome is complex, and indicates factors that could explain previously reported contradicting findings. This, in turn, will help guide future studies to fully understand the relationship between tumor regression and outcome.</p>"
0,A new strategy for craniospinal axis localization and adaptive dosimetric evaluation using cone beam CT,32140087,2020/01/01,"<h3>Background and aim</h3><p>Computational complexities encountered in craniospinal irradiation (CSI) have been widely investigated with different planning strategies. However, localization of the entire craniospinal axis (CSA) and evaluation of adaptive treatment plans have traditionally been ignored in CSI treatment. In this study, a new strategy for CSI with comprehensive CSA localization and adaptive plan evaluation has been demonstrated using cone beam CT with extended longitudinal field-of-view (CBCT<sub>eLFOV</sub>).</p><h3>Materials and methods</h3><p>Multi-scan CBCT images were acquired with fixed longitudinal table translations (with 1 cm cone-beam overlap) and then fused into a single DICOM-set using the custom software coded in MatLab™. A novel approach for validation of CBCT<sub>eLFOV</sub> was demonstrated by combined geometry of Catphan-504 and Catphan-604 phantoms. To simulate actual treatment scenarios, at first, the end-to-end workflow of CSI with VMAT was investigated using an anthropomorphic phantom and then applied for two patients (based on random selection).</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The fused CBCT<sub>eLFOV</sub> images were in excellent agreement with planning CT (pCT). The custom developed software effectively manages spatial misalignments arising out of the uncertainties in treatment/setup geometry. Although the structures mapped from pCT to CBCT<sub>eLFOV</sub> showed minimal variations, a maximum spatial displacement of up to 1.2 cm (and the mean of 0.8 ± 0.3 cm) was recorded in phantom study. Adaptive plan evaluation of patient paradigms showed the likelihood of under-dosing the craniospinal target.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Our protocol serves as a guide for precise localization of entire CSA and to ensure adequate dose to the large and complex targets. It can also be adapted for other complex treatment techniques such as total-marrow-irradiation and total-lymphoid-irradiation.</p>"

The average infiltration of IDO1+ and CD8+ cells was calculated and expressed as total scores as previously described. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to describe overall and disease-free survival.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>In nodal-positive tumours (N+), IDO-positivity was associated with a reduced disease-free survival (DFS) (p = 0.063) and CD8-positivity with an impaired OS (p = 0.024). Patients with a N+ LARC and a high total IDO1 score showed a clear advantage regarding five-year disease-free survival rates compared with patients with a low total IDO1 score (N+ 5y-DFS IDO1 high: 66.7% vs IDO low: 19%). We also detected better 5-years-OS rates in N+ LARC with a high total CD8 score (N+ 5y-OS CD8 high: 83.3% vs CD8 low: 32.3%). These survival benefits were not evident in patients with N-tumours.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Analysis of the local CD8 and IDO1 expression influences prognosis in nodal-positive LARC patients after multimodal therapy and may be a helpful tool in specifying individual adjuvant treatment strategies according to different immune profiles.</p>"
0,"Precursor Lesions of the Vocal Cord: a Study on the Diagnostic Role of Histomorphology, Histometry and Ki-67 Proliferation",30484261,2020/1/01,"The precise typing of precursor lesions of squamous cell carcinoma of vocal cord is of vital importance since it determines the line of therapy and prognosis. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the possible value of the types of dyskeratosis, histometry and cell proliferation rate in discriminating these lesions. The present retrospective study was based on 145 patients, classified according to the updated 2017 WHO system and included: Low-grade dysplasia (24 cases), high -grade dysplasia (53 cases), carcinoma insitu (33 cases) and microinvasive carcinomas (35 cases). Cell proliferation was assessed by immunoreactivity to Ki-67. For histometry and quantitation of Ki-67 proliferation rate, an image analysis system was used (Leica LAS, Wetzlar, Germany). Epithelial pearls (cell nests) were commonly observed in microinvasive carcinoma (82.9%) than high-grade dysplasia (5.9%). The median epithelial thickness, as well as, proliferation rate showed a significant increase according to the grade of the lesion. It is concluded that dyskeratosis pattern, histometry and Ki-67proliferation rate are valuable parameters to characterize precursor lesions. The presence of epithelial pearls, thickness &gt; 450 μm and Ki-67 &gt; 40% denote high risk lesions that require adequate excision and/or radiotherapy."
0,Glutamine synthetase facilitates cancer cells to recover from irradiation-induced G2/M arrest,31526079,2020/01/01,"Resistance to radiation of cancer cells can be either intrinsic or acquired, leading to treatment failure. In response to DNA damage caused by IR, cancer cells are arrested in cell cycle showing limited proliferation and increased apoptosis. However, radiation-resistant cells are able to overcome the cell cycle block and proceed to proliferation, for which the detailed mechanism remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we showed that radioresistant cells exhibited a recoverable G2/M phase during prolonged cell cycle and manifested lower apoptosis rate and more colony formation. RNA-seq analysis revealed that glutamine synthetase (GS, GLUL) gene was highly expressed in radioresistant cancer cells in comparison with the parental cells, which was in accordance with the G2/M arrest after ionizing radiation. Knocking out of GS in radioresistant cells resulted in a delayed G2/M recovery and lowered proliferation rate after ionizing radiation treatment, which was accompanied with increased inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 at Y15 and downregulated Cdc25B, a dual specific phosphatase of CDK1. Moreover, there was an enhanced complex formation of CDK1 and Cyclin B1 when the cells were rescued by re-introducing GS. In vivo, knocking down of GS significantly sensitized CNE2-R xenografts to RT in mice. In this study, we demonstrate a novel role of glutamine synthetase independent of metabolic function in promoting recovery from G2/M arrest caused by ionizing radiation, thus, causing cancer cell resistance to radiotherapy."

Two calibration protocols recommended by the AAPM (TG-61) and the IAEA (TRS-398) for low-energy photon beams were evaluated. The required Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were carried out using PENELOPE2014. Several MC simulations were performed modifying the flattening filter thickness and the x-ray tube potential, generating one absorbed depth-dose curve and a complete set of parameters required in the beam calibration (i.e., HVL, backscatter factor (B<sub>w</sub> ), and mass energy-absorption coefficient ratios (µ<sub>en</sub> /ρ)<sub>water,air</sub> ), for each configuration. Fits between each parameter and some absorbed dose-ratios calculated from the absorbed depth-dose curves were established. The effect of the manufacturing tolerances and the absorbed dose-ratio uncertainties over the calibration process were evaluated by propagating their values over the fitting function, comparing the overall calibration uncertainties against reference values. We proposed four scenarios of uncertainty (from 0% to 10%) in the dose-ratio determination to evaluate its effect in the calibration process.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The manufacturing tolerance of the flattening filter (±0.035 mm) produces a change of 1.4% in the calculated HVL and a negligible effect over the B<sub>w</sub> , (µ<sub>en</sub> /ρ)<sub>water,air</sub> , and the overall calibration uncertainty. A potential variation of 14% of the electron energies due to manufacturing tolerances in the x-ray tube (69.5 ± ~10 keV) generates a variation of 10% in the HVL. However, this change has a negligible effect over the B<sub>w</sub> and (µ<sub>en</sub> /ρ)<sub>water,air</sub> , adding 0.1% to the overall calibration uncertainty. The fitting functions reproduce the data with an uncertainty (k = 2) below 1%, 0.5%, and 0.4% for the HVL, B<sub>w</sub> , and (µ<sub>en</sub> /ρ)<sub>water,air</sub> , respectively. The four studied absorbed dose-ratio uncertainty scenarios add, in the worst-case scenario, 0.2% to the overall uncertainty of the calibration process.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>This work shows the feasibility of using the absorbed depth-dose curve in the calibration of an eBT system with minimal loss of precision.</p>"
0,Immune profile and immunosurveillance in treatment-naive and neoadjuvantly treated esophageal adenocarcinoma,31960110,2020/4/01,"The outcome in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is still poor with only 20% of patients in Western populations surviving for more than 5 years. Almost nothing is known about the precise composition of immune cells and their gene expression profiles in primary resected EACs and also nothing compared to neoadjuvant treated EACs. This study analyzes and compares immune profiles of primary resected and neoadjuvant treated esophageal adenocarcinoma and unravels possible targets for immunotherapy. We analyzed 47 EAC in total considering a set of 30 primary treatment-naive EACs and 17 neoadjuvant pretreated (12 × CROSS, 5 × FLOT) using the Nanostring's panel-based gene expression platform including 770 genes being important in malignant tumors and their immune micromileu. Most of the significantly altered genes are involved in the regulation of immune responses, T-and B cell functions as well as antigen processing. Chemokine-receptor axes like the CXCL9, -10,-11/CXCR3- are prominent in esophageal adenocarcinoma with a fold change of up to 9.5 promoting cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. ARG1, as a regulator of T-cell fate is sixfold down-regulated in untreated primary esophageal tumors. The influence of the currently used neoadjuvant treatment revealed a down-regulation of nearly all important checkpoint markers and inflammatory related genes in the local microenvironment. We found a higher expression of checkpoint markers like LAG3, TIM3, CTLA4 and CD276 in comparison to PD-L1/PD-1 supporting clinical trials analyzing the efficacy of a combination of different checkpoint inhibitors in EACs. We found an up-regulation of CD38 or LILRB1 as examples of additional immune escape mechanism."

The median OS was 12 months (95% CI 9-20 months). The median follow-up was 30 months (95% CI 28-49). Twenty-eight patients with newly diagnosed BM initiated anti-PD-1 +/-CTLA-4 therapy (n = 18), ipilimumab monotherapy (n = 10) or BRAF+/- MEK inhibitors (n = 11), during the 9 weeks before or after SRS.

0,Heating technology for malignant tumors: a review,32579419,2020/01/01,"The therapeutic application of heat is very effective in cancer treatment. Both hyperthermia, i.e., heating to 39-45 °C to induce sensitization to radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and thermal ablation, where temperatures beyond 50 °C destroy tumor cells directly are frequently applied in the clinic. Achievement of an effective treatment requires high quality heating equipment, precise thermal dosimetry, and adequate quality assurance. Several types of devices, antennas and heating or power delivery systems have been proposed and developed in recent decades. These vary considerably in technique, heating depth, ability to focus, and in the size of the heating focus. Clinically used heating techniques involve electromagnetic and ultrasonic heating, hyperthermic perfusion and conductive heating. Depending on clinical objectives and available technology, thermal therapies can be subdivided into three broad categories: local, locoregional, or whole body heating. Clinically used local heating techniques include interstitial hyperthermia and ablation, high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), scanned focused ultrasound (SFUS), electroporation, nanoparticle heating, intraluminal heating and superficial heating. Locoregional heating techniques include phased array systems, capacitive systems and isolated perfusion. Whole body techniques focus on prevention of heat loss supplemented with energy deposition in the body, e.g., by infrared radiation. This review presents an overview of clinical hyperthermia and ablation devices used for local, locoregional, and whole body therapy. Proven and experimental clinical applications of thermal ablation and hyperthermia are listed. Methods for temperature measurement and the role of treatment planning to control treatments are discussed briefly, as well as future perspectives for heating technology for the treatment of tumors."

Current Procedural Terminology and relative value unit codes encompassing anesthesia-related charges from radiation oncology and anesthesia were analyzed in concert with this value to calculate the total cost of pediatric anesthesia per RT session.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The mean number of RT fractions administered per patient with AVATAR-directed anesthesia omission at our institution was 19.0, similar to the 17.6 previously reported. At a mean anesthesia time exceeding 30 minutes (with mean RT duration of 4 weeks), the cost of pediatric anesthesia per RT fraction in non-AVATAR sessions was $1,904.35, yielding a total RT treatment anesthesia cost of $38,087.00 per patient (including simulation). Patients at our institution were not billed for AVATAR-assisted RT.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>The ability of AVATAR to obviate the need for daily anesthesia in pediatric RT provides substantial cost-savings.

This study presents a methodology that minimizes potential errors during the automated segmentation of tumors in PET images. Iterative blind deconvolution was implemented in a region of interest encompassing the tumor with the number of iterations determined from contrast-to-noise ratios. The active contour and random forest classification-based segmentation method was evaluated using three distinct image databases that included both synthetic and real heterogeneous tumors. Ground truths about tumor volumes were known precisely. The volumes of the tumors were in the range of 0.49-26.34 cm<sup>3</sup>, 0.64-1.52 cm<sup>3</sup>, and 40.38-203.84 cm<sup>3</sup> respectively. Widely available software tools, namely, MATLAB, MIPAV, and ITK-SNAP were utilized. When using the active contour method, image restoration reduced mean errors in volumes estimation from 95.85 to 3.37%, from 815.63 to 17.45%, and from 32.61 to 6.80% for the three datasets. The accuracy gains were higher using datasets that include smaller tumors for which PVE is known to be more predominant. Computation time was reduced by a factor of about 10 in the smaller deconvolution region. Contrast-to-noise ratios were improved for all tumors in all data. The presented methodology has the potential to improve delineation accuracy in particular for smaller tumors at practically feasible computational times.

Future developments include incorporating dose/outcome data to optimise dose distributions with optimal coverage of the high-risk areas, while at the same time limiting doses to low-risk areas. An infinite gradient of volumes and doses to deliver spatially-adjusted radiation can be generated, allowing to avoid unnecessary radiation to organs at risk.

0,[MRI Connecting Functions and Anatomy: A New Bridge for Radiotherapy],32238681,2020/01/01,"Advances in medical devices have allowed the use of CT, MRI, and PET-CT for the diagnosis of tumors and the detailed evaluation of the extent of lesions. For several decades, CT has been established as the gold standard modality for the treatment planning of radiotherapy, while MRI has emerged as a tool to evaluate the functional characteristics of tumors without radiation exposure. To further optimize precision radiation therapy, we should consider how functional images can be used in the workflow for radiation therapy. In this regard, MRI, as a modality without the need for a contrast agent, may allow more frequent scans and more detailed dose painting, such as increasing the dose to viable lesion parts while reducing the dose to less aggressive parts. Thus, a more personalized treatment based on precision radiation medicine might be realized. In recent years, MR-Linac systems (MRI integrated linear accelerator radiation therapy systems) have been applied in clinical settings by fusing MRI with Linac planning, and further development of radiation therapy utilizing MRI-derived functional images is expected. The use of MR-Linac techniques allows the characteristics of the tumor to be evaluated in more detail before treatment, and the treatment planning can be modified according to the position and characteristics of the tumor (which may change daily during irradiation) to avoid harming normal tissue. Compared with conventional cone beam CT, MR-Linac can offer MR images with much better contrast of soft tissue for image-guided radiation therapy, even when acquired at 0.35 T. A multicenter study of liver tumors using MR-Linac was recently reported. In current tumor imaging, various MRI sequences can be used to evaluate tumor functional information such as tumor heterogeneity, cell density, microenvironment, angiogenesis, necrosis, hypoxic status, and microstructure. In this article, we introduce state-of-the-art acquisition methods for MRI imaging, and discuss how the functional information obtained from these imaging methods can be useful for radiation therapy."

0,Attenuation of the inflammatory response and polarization of macrophages by photobiomodulation,32065300,2020/9/01,"In spinal cord injury (SCI), inflammation is a major mediator of damage and loss of function and is regulated primarily by the bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Photobiomodulation (PBM) or low-level light stimulation is known to have anti-inflammatory effects and has previously been used in the treatment of SCI, although its precise cellular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the effect of PBM at 810 nm on classically activated BMDMs was evaluated to investigate the mechanisms underlying its anti-inflammatory effects. BMDMs were cultured and irradiated (810 nm, 2 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide and interferon-γ. CCK-8 assay, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate assay, and ELISA and western blot analysis were performed to measure cell viability, reactive oxygen species production, and inflammatory marker production, respectively. PBM irradiation of classically activated macrophages significantly increased the cell viability and inhibited reactive oxygen species generation. PBM suppressed the expression of a marker of classically activated macrophages, inducible nitric oxide synthase; decreased the mRNA expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interleukin-1 beta; and increased the secretion of monocyte chemotactic protein 1. Exposure to PBM likewise significantly reduced the expression and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 in classically activated BMDMs. Taken together, these results suggest that PBM can successfully modulate inflammation and polarization in classically activated BMDMs. The present study provides a theoretical basis to support wider clinical application of PBM in the treatment of SCI."

0,Quantification of fiducial marker visibility for MRI-only prostate radiotherapy simulation,31881546,2020/02/05,"To objectively compare the suitability of MRI pulse sequences and commercially available fiducial markers (FMs) for MRI-only prostate radiotherapy simulation. Most FMs appear as small signal voids in MRI images making them difficult to differentiate from tissue heterogeneities such as calcifications. In this study we use quantitative metrics to objectively evaluate the visibility of FMs in 27 patients and an anthropomorphic phantom with a variety of standard clinical MRI pulse sequences and commercially available FMs. FM visibility was quantified using the local contrast-to-noise-ratio (lCNR), the difference between the 80th and 20th percentile iso-intensity FM volumes (V <sub>fall</sub>) and the largest iso-intensity volume that can be distinguished from background: apparent-marker-volume (AMV). A larger lCNR and AMV, and smaller V <sub>fall</sub> represents a more easily identifiable FM. The number of non-marker objects visualized by each pulse sequence was calculated using FM-derived template-matching. The FM-based target-registration-error (TRE) between each MRI and the planning-CT image was calculated. Fiducial marker visibility was rated by two medical physicists with over three years of experience examining MRI-only prostate simulation images. The rater's classification accuracy was quantified using the F <sub>1</sub> score, which is the harmonic mean of the rater's precision and recall. These quantitative metrics and human observer ratings were used to evaluate FM identifiability in images from nine subtypes of T <sub>1</sub>-weighted, T <sub>2</sub>-weighted and gradient echo (GRE) pulse sequences in a 27-patient study. A phantom study was conducted to quantify the visibility of 8 commercially available FMs. In the patient study, the largest mean lCNR and AMV and, smallest normalized V <sub>fall</sub> were produced by the 3.0 T multiple-echo GRE pulse sequence (T <sub>1</sub>-VIBE, 2° flip angle, 1.23 ms and 2.45 ms echo-times). This pulse sequence produced no false marker detections and TREs less than 2 mm in the left-right, anterior-posterior and cranial-caudal directions, respectively. Human observers rated the 1.23 ms echo-time GRE images with the best average marker visibility score of 100% and an F <sub>1</sub> score of 1. In the phantom study, the Gold-Anchor GA-200X-20-B (deployed in a folded configuration) produced the largest sequence averaged lCNR and AMV measurements at 16.1 and 16.7 mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively. Using quantitative visibility and distinguishability metrics and human observer ratings, the patient study demonstrated that multiple-echo GRE images produced the best gold FM visibility and distinguishability. The phantom study demonstrated that markers manufactured from platinum or iron-doped gold quantitatively produced superior visibility compared to their pure gold counterparts."

0,Recent Advances in the Development of Biomarkers and Chemoradiotherapeutic Approaches for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,32191137,2020/3/01,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in Southern China, and the prognosis of this cancer has improved in part due to advances in radiotherapy (RT) techniques, broadened therapeutic options, and more precise prognostic stratification of patients. RT is the primary curative treatment of NPC, and the incorporation of chemotherapy (induction, concurrent, adjuvant) to RT has contributed to improved survival in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in combination with adjuvant or induction chemotherapy is now the standard treatment of locoregionally advanced NPC, but the ideal CCRT therapeutic strategy for NPC remains controversial. Plasma EBV DNA is the archetypal tumor-derived DNA in NPC, and three generations of studies have gradually expanded its clinical applications. Recently, the advent of whole exome/genome sequencing of NPC and the promising clinical activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors have also spurred interest in the development of newer biomarkers. This review will focus on two clinical advances in NPC research that have made substantial impact on the contemporary management of NPC: (1) The integration of plasma EBV DNA in an expanding spectrum of clinical indications, and the development of promising immune-related biomarkers; (2) the current development of CCRT with special emphasis on the use of induction and adjuvant chemotherapy, as well as the potential applications of metronomic chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of locoregionally advanced NPC."
0,Transabdominal and transvesical laparoscopic correction of vesico-vaginal fistula: 42 cases experience,32022529,2020/01/01,"<h3>Introduction and Objective</h3><p> Several methods and techniques have been described for the treatment of vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) including abdominal, vaginal and endoscopic approaches. The development of laparoscopic surgery minimizes the morbidity associated with laparotomy, reducing the period of convalescence, being increasingly used in the management of VVF. This aim of this study is to present 42 cases of laparoscopic vesicovaginal fistula repair and to evaluate their results.</p><h3>Materials and Methods</h3><p> Forty-two patients with a diagnosis of VVF between 1998 and 2016 were included, with precise indications of abdominal surgical approach as recommended by Lee et al. (1) Cystoscopy, Retrograde urethrocystography and excretory urography confirmed the presence of VVF and ruled out ureteral lesions in all patients.</p><h3>Results</h3><p> Forty-two patients with VVF, mean age of 40.35 years (19-75 years), were treated. The most frequent cause of VVF was abdominal hysterectomy (80.95%) 34 patients (80.95%) had never been treated, while 7 patients (16.66%) had undergone unsuccessful abdominal surgical treatment. One patient (2.38%) underwent three attempts of correction, one vaginally and two abdominal without success. The average time of hospitalization was 3 days. The average duration of the vesical catheter was 12 days. Complications occurred in 4 patients (9.52%). Only 2 patients (4.76%) had recurrence at 40 and 90 days after their first surgery, both of them were previously submitted to radiotherapy.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p> The laparoscopic approach of VVF is an excellent alternative to the traditional abdominal approach. Therefore, it is a feasible, effective and minimally invasive method that can treat this entity.</p>"

Generated structures were evaluated against manual delineations on the repeated scans using intra-observer variation obtained on the planning MR as ground truth.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>MR-to-MR propagated structures had significant less median surface distance and larger Dice similarity index compared to CT-MR propagation. The MR-MR propagation uncertainty was similar in magnitude to the intra-observer variation. Visual inspection of the deformed structures revealed that small anatomical differences between organs in source and destination image sets were generally well accounted for while large differences were not.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Both CT and MR based propagations require manual editing, but the current results show that MR-to-MR propagated structures require fewer corrections for high risk prostate cancer patients treated at a high-field MRL.</p>"
0,Evaluation of newly implemented dose calculation algorithms for multileaf collimator-based CyberKnife tumor-tracking radiotherapy,31913508,2020/3/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>In the previous treatment planning system (TPS) for CyberKnife (CK), multileaf collimator (MLC)-based treatment plans could be created only by using the finite-size pencil beam (FSPB) algorithm. Recently, a new TPS, including the FSPB with lateral scaling option (FSPB+) and Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms, was developed. In this study, we performed basic and clinical end-to-end evaluations for MLC-based CK tumor-tracking radiotherapy using the MC, FSPB+, and FSPB.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Water- and lung-equivalent slab phantoms were combined to obtain the percentage depth dose (PDD) and off-center ratio (OCR). The CK M6 system and Precision TPS were employed, and PDDs and OCRs calculated by the MC, FSPB+, and FSPB were compared with the measured doses obtained for 30.8 × 30.8 mm<sup>2</sup> and 60.0 × 61.6 mm<sup>2</sup> fields. A lung motion phantom was used for clinical evaluation and MLC-based treatment plans were created using the MC. The doses were subsequently recalculated using the FSPB+ and FSPB, while maintaining the irradiation parameters. The calculated doses were compared with the doses measured using a microchamber (for target doses) or a radiochromic film (for dose profiles). The dose volume histogram (DVH) indices were compared for all plans.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>In homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantom geometries, the PDDs calculated by the MC and FSPB+ agreed with the measurements within ±2.0% for the region between the surface and a depth of 250 mm, whereas the doses calculated by the FSPB in the lung-equivalent phantom region were noticeably higher than the measurements, and the maximum dose differences were 6.1% and 4.4% for the 30.8 × 30.8 mm<sup>2</sup> and 60.0 × 61.6 mm<sup>2</sup> fields, respectively. The maximum distance to agreement values of the MC, FSPB+, and FSPB at the penumbra regions of OCRs were 1.0, 0.6, and 1.1 mm, respectively, but the best agreement was obtained between the MC-calculated curve and measurements at the boundary of the water- and lung-equivalent slabs, compared with those of the FSPB+ and FSPB. For clinical evaluations using the lung motion phantom, under the static motion condition, the dose errors measured by the microchamber were -1.0%, -1.9%, and 8.8% for MC, FSPB+, and FSPB, respectively; their gamma pass rates for the 3%/2 mm criterion comparing to film measurement were 98.4%, 87.6%, and 31.4% respectively. Under respiratory motion conditions, there was no noticeable decline in the gamma pass rates. In the DVH indices, for most of the gross tumor volume and planning target volume, significant differences were observed between the MC and FSPB, and between the FSPB+ and FSPB. Furthermore, significant differences were observed for lung D<sub>mean</sub> , V<sub>15 Gy</sub> , and V<sub>20 Gy</sub> between the MC, FSPB+, and FSPB.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>The results indicate that the doses calculated using the MC and FSPB+ differed remarkably in inhomogeneous regions, compared with the FSPB. Because the MC was the most consistent with the measurements, it is recommended for final dose calculations in inhomogeneous regions such as the lung. Furthermore, the sufficient accuracy of dose delivery using MLC-based tumor-tracking radiotherapy by CK was demonstrated for clinical implementation.</p>"

0,The Potential of PI3K/AKT/mTOR Signaling as a Druggable Target for Endometrial and Ovarian Carcinomas,31752654,2020/01/01,"<h3>Aims</h3><p>In this narrative review, we summarize the role and significance of PI3K-AKTmTOR (PAM) pathway in ovarian and endometrial cancers, providing the most recent and relevant literature on the topic and addressing options for targeting PAM along with future perspectives of drug development.</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Alterations of the PAM-pathway are common in both endometrial and ovarian cancers, and are described in specific histology-defined subtypes. PAM seems to be involved in critical steps of endometrial and ovarian carcinogenesis, often mechanistically involved in the acquisition of a phenotype of treatment resistance, which could be targetable. However, early clinical trials with PAMinhibitors (PAMi) have provided disappointing results, particularly when non isoform-specific inhibitors were tested in unselected populations, accompanied by an adverse safety profile. Since then, more encouraging observations have been collected when targeting specific isoforms of PAM proteins with more selective drugs, resulting in encouraging activity and more manageable toxicity.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Although the rationale of inhibiting the PAM-pathway has been demonstrated in several promising preclinical studies, no Phase III clinical trial is available to demonstrate a significant benefit of PAM-inhibitors. A way to manage targeted agents is to tailor their use to particular subpopulations most likely to obtain a considerable benefit, namely pursuing an individualized, precision-medicine approach.</p>"
0,The first prospective implementation of markerless lung target tracking in an experimental quality assurance procedure on a standard linear accelerator,31783395,2020/01/17,"The ability to track tumour motion without implanted markers on a standard linear accelerator (linac) could enable wide access to real-time adaptive radiotherapy for cancer patients. We previously have retrospectively validated a method for 3D markerless target tracking using intra-fractional kilovoltage (kV) projections acquired on a standard linac. This paper presents the first prospective implementation of markerless lung target tracking on a standard linac and its quality assurance (QA) procedure. The workflow and the algorithm developed to track the 3D target position during volumetric modulated arc therapy treatment delivery were optimised. The linac was operated in clinical QA mode, while kV projections were streamed to a dedicated computer using a frame-grabber software. The markerless target tracking accuracy and precision were measured in a lung phantom experiment under the following conditions: static localisation of seven distinct positions, dynamic localisation of five patient-measured motion traces, and dynamic localisation with treatment interruption. The QA guidelines were developed following the AAPM Task Group 147 report with the requirement that the tracking margin components, the margins required to account for tracking errors, did not exceed 5 mm in any direction. The mean tracking error ranged from 0.0 to 0.9 mm (left-right), -0.6 to -0.1 mm (superior-inferior) and -0.7 to 0.1 mm (anterior-posterior) over the three tests. Larger errors were found in cases with large left-right or anterior-posterior and small superior-inferior motion. The tracking margin components did not exceed 5 mm in any direction and ranged from 0.4 to 3.2 mm (left-right), 0.7 to 1.6 mm (superior-inferior) and 0.8 to 1.5 mm (anterior-posterior). This study presents the first prospective implementation of markerless lung target tracking on a standard linac and provides a QA procedure for its safe clinical implementation, potentially enabling real-time adaptive radiotherapy for a large population of lung cancer patients."

In the present study, the total forms (free plus conjugated) of four parent parabens, such as methylparaben (MeP), ethylparaben (EtP), propylparaben (PrP), and butylparaben (BuP), and four metabolites, namely methyl protocatechuate (OH-MeP), ethyl protocatechuate (OH-EtP), p-hydroxy benzoic acid (4-HB), and 3,4-dihydroxy benzoic acid (3,4-DHB), were detected in paired urine and blood samples collected from 196 Chinese university students. The median urinary and blood parabens and their metabolites concentrations ranged from 0.24 to 167 ng/mL and from &lt;0.02 to 2.88 ng/mL, respectively. MeP was the predominant parent parabens, accounting for 68% and 52% of urine and blood samples, respectively. Furthermore, 4-HB predominantly contributed to the parabens and their metabolites in urine (54%) and blood (41%). Significant positive correlations were observed between the urinary levels and blood levels. Moreover, relatively high levels of parabens and their metabolites were detected in urine samples. Our results imply that urinary concentrations are good predictors of human exposure to parabens and metabolites. Gender-related difference in urinary concentrations of parabens and their metabolites were found. The median urinary levels of the tested compounds in females were significantly higher than those in males (Mann Whitney U test, p &lt; 0.05 or 0.01). The estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of MeP, EtP, and PrP were also evaluated.

Twelve patients out the 196 were not followed up, so we analysed 184 patients' data. We performed laparoscopic surgery on 67 patients. Conversion happened on 15 patients out of the 67 cases. Open surgery was performed on 117 patients. We strived for the ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery at the origin, the sparing of the autonomic nerves and the precise implementation of TME. The splenic flexure has been taken down during the operations that involved resection. <i>Results:</i> The Dukes stages as well as the, ASA stages were similar in both groups. There was no significant difference in the patients' BMI either. The length of the removed specimens and the tumour size were similar too. The defining factors of recurrence are the involvement of the circumferential resection margin (CRM) and the complete execution of the TME. These were appropriate in our laparoscopic cases, and we did not find a significant difference in between the groups (Chi-square test, <i>p</i> = 0.94). The operation time was similar in the laparoscopic, converted and open surgeries, and there was no significant difference either. The shortest postoperative care time was in the laparoscopic group, but the Mann-Whitney test did not reveal a significant difference. Similarly to literature data, we experienced much less wound-related complications like infections and fever in the laparoscopic group. There was a significant difference in terms of transfusion demand comparing the laparoscopic and open operation groups, to the detriment of the open surgery group (Chi-square test, <i>p</i> = 0.04). We did not find a significant difference in recurrence or survival during follow-up of the patients. <i>Conclusion:</i> In addition to the short-term advantages of laparoscopic surgery, it is a safe procedure for the chemo-irradiated rectum tumours even from an oncological point of view. Both open and laparoscopic surgery requires high-level competency and qualification and these must be performed in centres."
0,Electron beam radiotherapy for Kaposi's sarcoma of the toe and web,32362628,2020/01/01,"Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an uncommon neoplastic vascular disease. The standard treatment for localized classic KS lesions is surgical excision or radiation. Superficial skin lesions are generally treated with electrons or low-energy photon fields using boluses. Radiotherapy (RT) can be used for poor surgical candidates or when surgery is expected to result in a poor cosmetic or functional outcome. This study is the first to describe a case of KS of the toe and web treated with electron RT, which precisely targeted the irregular skin lesion with a markedly higher presided effective treatment. An electron field is often limited in its effectiveness to deliver a homogeneous dose in cases with irregular contours. Here, we report our successful experience using low-energy electron beam radiation to treat KS of the toe and web. The patient was a 78-year-old woman who was diagnosed with KS located on the first and second toe and web, based on radiology, pathology, and immunohistochemical examinations. KS was located on the left foot and measured more than 2.5 cm. No regional nodal or distant organ metastasis was observed. She was medically inoperable. RT was performed using a 6-MeV electron with a 0.5-cm bolus and a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions. Follow-up computed tomography 2 months after RT revealed a complete tumor response. Toxicity was limited to mild skin desquamation during treatment. The patient remains alive and has shown no evidence of disease for 2 years. This study suggests that electron RT is a safe and effective treatment option for skin lesions located on the toe and web."
0,Establishment of epigenetic markers to predict irradiation efficacy against oropharyngeal cancer,32012407,2020/4/01,"Irradiation, or chemoradiotherapy, is a curative treatment for oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Its invasiveness, however, can often negate its efficacy. Therefore, developing methods to predict which patients would benefit from irradiation is urgent. Promoter DNA hypermethylation was recently reported to correlate with favorable OPSCC prognosis. It is still unclear, however, whether there is an association between promoter DNA methylation and response to irradiation. In this study, we analyzed DNA methylation in the specimens from 40 OPSCC patients who had undergone irradiation, using the Infinium assay. Our results showed significant correlation between high levels of promoter DNA methylation and better response to treatment (P &lt; 0.01). We used the 10 most differentially-methylated genes between responders and non-responders to develop a panel of predictive markers for efficacy. Our panel had high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy (92%, 93% and 93%, respectively). We conducted pyrosequencing to quantitatively validate the methylation levels of 8 of the 10 marker genes (ROBO1, ULK4P3, MYOD1, LBX1, CACNA1A, IRX4, DPYSL3 and ELAVL2) obtained by Infinium. The validation by pyrosequencing showed that these 8 genes had a high prediction performance for the training set of 40 specimens and for a validation set of 35 OPSCC specimens, showing 96% sensitivity, 89% specificity and 94% accuracy. Methylation of these markers correlated significantly with better progression-free and overall survival rates, regardless of human papillomavirus status. These results indicate that increased DNA methylation is associated with better responses to irradiation therapy and that DNA methylation can help establish efficacy prediction markers in OPSCC."
0,Biological Determinants of Chemo-Radiotherapy Response in HPV-Negative Head and Neck Cancer: A Multicentric External Validation,31998639,2020/01/10,"<b>Purpose:</b> Tumor markers that are related to hypoxia, proliferation, DNA damage repair and stem cell-ness, have a prognostic value in advanced stage HNSCC patients when assessed individually. Here we aimed to evaluate and validate this in a multifactorial context and assess interrelation and the combined role of these biological factors in determining chemo-radiotherapy response in HPV-negative advanced HNSCC. <b>Methods:</b> RNA sequencing data of pre-treatment biopsy material from 197 HPV-negative advanced stage HNSCC patients treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy was analyzed. Biological parameter scores were assigned to patient samples using previously generated and described gene expression signatures. Locoregional control rates were used to assess the role of these biological parameters in radiation response and compared to distant metastasis data. Biological factors were ranked according to their clinical impact using bootstrapping methods and multivariate Cox regression analyses that included clinical variables. Multivariate Cox regression analyses comprising all biological variables were used to define their relative role among all factors when combined. <b>Results:</b> Only few biomarker scores correlate with each other, underscoring their independence. The different biological factors do not correlate or cluster, except for the two stem cell markers CD44 and SLC3A2 (<i>r</i> = 0.4, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and acute hypoxia prediction scores which correlated with T-cell infiltration score, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell abundance and proliferation scores (<i>r</i> = 0.52, 0.56, and 0.6, respectively with <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Locoregional control association analyses revealed that chronic (Hazard Ratio (HR) = 3.9) and acute hypoxia (HR = 1.9), followed by stem cell-ness (CD44/SLC3A2; HR = 2.2/2.3), were the strongest and most robust determinants of radiation response. Furthermore, multivariable analysis, considering other biological and clinical factors, reveal a significant role for EGFR expression (HR = 2.9, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) and T-cell infiltration (CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells: HR = 2.2, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05; CD8<sup>+</sup>T-cells/Treg: HR = 2.6, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) signatures in locoregional control of chemoradiotherapy-treated HNSCC. <b>Conclusion:</b> Tumor acute and chronic hypoxia, stem cell-ness, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell parameters are relevant and largely independent biological factors that together contribute to locoregional control. The combined analyses illustrate the additive value of multifactorial analyses and support a role for EGFR expression analysis and immune cell markers in addition to previously validated biomarkers. This external validation underscores the relevance of biological factors in determining chemoradiotherapy outcome in HNSCC."

0,Evaluation of metal artefact techniques with same contrast scale for different commercially available dual-energy computed tomography scanners,32524438,2020/6/01,"The aim of our study is to evaluate the metal artefact reduction techniques with the same contrast scale for different vendors' dual-energy CT (DECT): kV-CT image with metal artefact reduction method and monoenergetic CT image using Canon's DECT, and monoenergetic CT image with metal artefact reduction method using GE's DECT. The kV-CT image and DECT scans were performed with the water-based polymethyl methacrylate phantom with various metal materials (brass, aluminium, copper, stainless steel, steel, lead, and titanium). Two types of metal artefact reduction (MAR) algorithm with the monoenergetic CT images were used. Smart MAR implemented by GE and the kV-CT images with MAR algorithms. Single-energy metal artefact reduction (SEMAR), implemented by Canon, was reconstructed. The artefact index was evaluated using the converted electron density values from the kV-CT and DECT images. The artefact index with all material inserts in the monoenergetic CT images were smallest at 70-90 keV for Canon and 140 keV for GE. The artefact index without SEMAR was larger than that with SEMAR for the 80 and 135-kV CT images. In the comparison of the artefact index for the converted electron density images from the 80 and 135-kV CT images with SEMAR, as well as the monoenergetic CT images with and without MAR, the monoenergetic CT image at 140 keV with MAR showed a reduction. In the comparison of the monoenergetic CT images at 140 keV and other energy ranges without and with Smart MAR, there was no statistically significant difference (P &lt; 0.05) for all-metal inserts at more than 100 keV for Canon's DECT and 70 keV for GE's DECT. The metal artefact could be reduced by using a monoenergetic CT image at high energy with MAR algorithm. The metal artefact for the different-contrast-scale images can be compared on the same contrast scale by the electron density conversion method."

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy on survival, recurrence, and toxicities in pathologic T3N0M0 TESCC.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>This study included 582 patients with pT3N0M0 TESCC who were treated at Sichuan Cancer Hospital from January 2009 to December 2017. The patients were divided into two groups: surgery plus postoperative chemotherapy group (S + POCT), and surgery group (S group). Propensity score matching was used to create patient groups that were balanced across several covariates (n = 236 in each group). Outcome measures included overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).</p><h3>Results</h3><p>After PSM, both groups have balance factors. S + POCT have significantly improved the 5-year OS and DFS (OS, 70.8% vs. 52.8%, p &lt;0.0001; DFS, 66.5% vs. 50.2%, p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariate Cox analyses in the matched samples revealed that S + POCT were independently associated with longer OS (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.56, 95% confidence index (CI) 0.41-0.77, p &lt; 0.0001) and longer DFS (HR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.82, p = 0.001) than surgery alone.

A multicenter, randomized, phase III clinical trial is warranted to confirm these findings.</p>"
0,Impact of a low FODMAP diet on the amount of rectal gas and rectal volume during radiotherapy in patients with prostate cancer - a prospective pilot study,32000818,2020/01/30,"<h3>Background</h3><p>Small inter- and intrafractional prostate motion was shown to be a prerequisite for precise radiotherapy (RT) of prostate cancer (PCa) to achieve good local control and low rectal toxicity. As rectal gas and rectal volume are known to have a relevant effect on prostate motion, this study aims to reduce these parameters by using a Low FODMAP Diet (LFD) and to show feasibility of this intervention.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>We compared a prospective intervention group (IG, n = 25) which underwent RT for PCa and whose patients were asked to follow a LFD during RT with a retrospective control group (CG, n = 25) which did not get any dietary advice. In the planning CT scan and all available cone beam CT scans rectal gas was classified based on a semiquantitative score (scale from 1 to 5) and rectal volume was measured. Furthermore, patients' compliance was evaluated by a self-assessment questionnaire.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Clinical and treatment characteristics were well balanced between both groups. A total of 266 (CG, 10.6 per patient) and 280 CT scans (IG, 11.2 per patient), respectively, were analysed. The frequency distribution of gas scores differed significantly from each other (p &lt; .001) with the IG having lower scores. Rectal volume was smaller in the IG (64.28 cm<sup>3</sup>, 95% CI 60.92-67.65 cm<sup>3</sup>, SD 28.64 cm<sup>3</sup>) than in the CG (71.40 cm<sup>3</sup>, 95% CI 66.47-76.32 cm<sup>3</sup>, SD 40.80 cm<sup>3</sup>) (p = .02). Mean intrapatient standard deviation as a measure for the variability of rectal volume was 22 cm<sup>3</sup> in the IG and 23 cm<sup>3</sup> in the CG (p = .81). Patients' compliance and contentment were satisfying.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>The use of a LFD significantly decreased rectal gas and rectal volume. LFD was feasible with an excellent patients' compliance.

All radiotherapy (RT) techniques and all chemotherapeutic agents used to manage this disease were included. No differences were found in terms of duration (P=0.67) and dose (P=0.53) of RT, while CT results were contradictory. Acute and hematological toxicities were significantly higher in HIV-positive patients, while gastrointestinal, dermatological and chronic toxicities did not significantly differ between the two groups. Given the high heterogeneity of the studies, no objective comparison could be made between studies that included antiretrovirals and those that did not.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>HIV-positive patients may be at higher risk for acute and hematological toxicity than HIV-negative patients. A precise conclusion cannot be drawn on the use of antiretrovirals, given the high heterogeneity of data.</p>"
0,Development of a CT number calibration audit phantom in photon radiation therapy: A pilot study,32026482,2020/4/01,"<h3>Purpose</h3><p>In photon radiation therapy, computed tomography (CT) numbers are converted into values for mass density (MD) or relative electron density to water (RED). CT-MD or CT-RED calibration tables are relevant for human body dose calculation in an inhomogeneous medium. CT-MD or CT-RED calibration tables are influenced by patient imaging (CT scanner manufacturer, scanning parameters, and patient size), the calibration process (tissue-equivalent phantom manufacturer, and selection of tissue-equivalent material), differences between tissue-equivalent materials and standard tissues, and the dose calculation algorithm applied; however, a CT number calibration audit has not been established. The purposes of this study were to develop a postal audit phantom, and to establish a CT number calibration audit process.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>A conventional stoichiometric calibration conducts a least square fit of the relationships between the MD, material weight, and measured CT number, using two parameters. In this study, a new stoichiometric CT number calibration scheme has been empirically established, using three parameters to harmonize the calculated CT number with the measured CT number for air and lung tissue. In addition, the suitable material set and the minimal number of materials required for stoichiometric CT number calibration were determined. The MDs and elemental weights from the International Commission on Radiological Protection Publication 110 were used as standard tissue data, to generate the CT-MD and CT-RED calibration tables. A small-sized, CT number calibration phantom was developed for a postal audit, and stoichiometric CT number calibration with the phantom was compared to the CT number calibration tables registered in the radiotherapy treatment planning systems (RTPSs) associated with five radiotherapy institutions.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>When a least square fit was performed for the stoichiometric CT number calibration with the three parameters, the calculated CT number showed better agreement with the measured CT number. We established stoichiometric CT number calibration using only two materials because the accuracy of the process was determined not by the number of used materials but by the number of elements contained. The stoichiometric CT number calibration was comparable to the tissue-substitute calibration, with a dose difference less than 1%. An outline of the CT number calibration audit was demonstrated through a multi-institutional study.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>We established a new stoichiometric CT number calibration method for validating the CT number calibration tables registered in RTPSs. We also developed a CT number calibration phantom for a postal audit, which was verified by the performances of multiple CT scanners located at several institutions. The new stoichiometric CT number calibration has the advantages of being performed using only two materials, and decreasing the difference between the calculated and measured CT numbers for air and lung tissue. In the future, a postal CT number calibration audit might be achievable using a smaller phantom.</p>"
0,Prediction of Response to Preoperative Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Locally Advanced Cervical Cancer Using Multicenter CT-Based Radiomic Analysis,32117732,2020/02/04,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate whether pre-treatment CT-derived radiomic features could be applied for prediction of clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC). <b>Patients and Methods:</b> Two hundred and seventy-seven LACC patients treated with NACT followed by surgery/radiotherapy were included in this multi-institution retrospective study. One thousand and ninety-four radiomic features were extracted from venous contrast enhanced and non-enhanced CT imaging for each patient. Five combined methods of feature selection were used to reduce dimension of features. Radiomics signature was constructed by Random Forest (RF) method in a primary cohort of 221 patients. A combined model incorporating radiomics signature with clinical factors was developed using multivariable logistic regression. Prediction performance was then tested in a validation cohort of 56 patients. <b>Results:</b> Radiomics signature containing pre- and post-contrast imaging features can adequately distinguish chemotherapeutic responders from non-responders in both primary and validation cohorts [AUCs: 0.773 (95% CI, 0.701-0.845) and 0.816 (95% CI, 0.690-0.942), respectively] and remain relatively stable across centers. The combined model has a better predictive performance with an AUC of 0.803 (95% CI, 0.734-0.872) in the primary set and an AUC of 0.821 (95% CI, 0.697-0.946) in the validation set, compared to radiomics signature alone. Both models showed good discrimination, calibration. <b>Conclusion:</b> Newly developed radiomic model provided an easy-to-use predictor of chemotherapeutic response with improved predictive ability, which might facilitate optimal treatment strategies tailored for individual LACC patients."
0,[Estimation of Dynamic MLC Parameters Using Dynamic MLC Position Accuracy Analysis Software in Prostate IMRT],32963139,2020/01/01,"It is necessary to verify an intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan and to confirm dose error within the tolerance, in order to perform it securely and precisely. IMRT with dynamic multi-leaf collimator (DMLC) requires high DMLC position accuracy. The DMLC position accuracy analysis software DynaLog File Viewer (DFV; Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA, USA) is used to analyze position errors of DMLC for IMRT plans. We analyzed correlation between DMLC parameters and position error of DMLC obtained from DFV in prostate IMRT. A regression analysis of the position error and the DMLC parameters was performed. As a result, a strong correlation was found between MLC position error and each of the DMLC parameters: leaf speed, gap width, and segment monitor unit (MU).

For the evaluation set, the average mean-square-error decreased from 4.7 × [Formula: see text] between AAA and AXB to 7.0 × 10<sup>-5</sup> between DDN and AXB, with an average improvement of ~12 times. The average Gamma index passing rate at 3mm3% improved from 76% between AAA and AXB to 91% between DDN and AXB. The average calculation time is less than 1 ms for a single slice on a NVIDIA DGX workstation. DDN, trained with a large amount of dosimetric data, can be employed as a general-purpose dose calculation acceleration engine across various dose calculation algorithms."
0,Automatic detection of brachytherapy seeds in 3D ultrasound images using a convolutional neural network,31860899,2020/02/05,"A novel approach for automatic localization of brachytherapy seeds in 3D transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) images, using machine learning based algorithm, is presented. 3D radiofrequency ultrasound signals were collected from 13 patients using the linear array of the TRUS probe during the brachytherapy procedure in which needles are used for insertion of stranded seeds. Gold standard for the location of seeds on TRUS data were obtained with the guidance of the complete reconstruction of the seed locations from multiple C-arm fluoroscopy views and used in the creation of the training set. We designed and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that worked on 3D cubical sub-regions of the TRUS images, that will be referred to as patches, representing seed, non-seed within a needle track and non-seed elsewhere in the images. The models were trained with these patches to detect the needle track first and then the individual seeds within the needle track. A leave-one-out cross validation approach was used to test the model on the data from eight of the patients, for whom accurate seed locations were available from fluoroscopic imaging. The total inference time was about 7 min for needle track detection in each patient's image and approximately 1 min for seed detection in each needle, leading to a total seed detection time of less than 15 min. Our seed detection algorithm achieved [Formula: see text] precision, [Formula: see text] recall and [Formula: see text] F1_score. The results from our CNN-based method were compared to manual seed localization performed by an expert. The CNN model yielded higher precision (lower false discovery rate) compared to the manual method. The automated approach requires little modification to the current clinical setups and offers the prospect of application in real time intraoperative dosimetric analysis of the implant."

PLINK set-based tests and subsequent individual SNP association analyses were conducted to identify genes and SNPs associated with EASR among the 53 DDR genes and 1968 SNPs. A weighted polygenic risk score (PRS) model was constructed to ascertain the association between the joint effect of risk alleles and EASR.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The study population consisted of 264 Hispanic whites, 86 blacks or African Americans, 55 non-Hispanic whites, and 11 others. A total of 115 patients (27.6%) developed EASR. Five genes (ATM, CHEK1, ERCC2, RAD51C, and TGFB1) were significantly associated with RT-induced EASR. Nine SNPs within these 5 genes were further identified: ATM rs61915066, CHEK1 rs11220184, RAD51C rs302877, rs405684, TBFB1 rs4803455, rs2241714, and ERCC2 rs60152947, rs10404465, rs1799786.

PRS modeling showed its potential in identifying populations at risk. Multiple SNPs in DDR genes may jointly contribute to interindividual variation in RT-induced EASR. Validation in an independent external cohort is required to determine the clinical significance of these predictive biomarkers.</p>"

0,Radioactive Iodine Therapy in Patients With Thyroid Carcinoma With Distant Metastases: A SEER-Based Study,32292051,2020/01/01,"Distant metastasis (DM) is the dominant negative prognosis for thyroid carcinoma. Radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy serves as an effective treatment for thyroid carcinoma. However, resistance to RAI occurs in patients with DMs. The present study aims to discriminate patients who may benefit from RAI. We extracted patients with thyroid cancer in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program and analyzed thyroid cancer-specific survival after radiotherapy based on age and grade subgroups. A total of 1608 patients having DMs were eligible, including 521 (32.4%) cases with bone metastasis, 90 (5.6%) cases with brain metastasis, 158 (9.8%) cases with liver metastasis, 995 (61.9%) cases with lung metastasis, and 50 (3.1%) cases with other metastases. Advanced age, poor differentiation, follicular carcinoma, lymphatic metastasis, tumor size &gt;10 mm, and extracapsular invasion are associated with pulmonary metastases. With respect to patients with DM, RAI therapy improved the survival in the age &lt;45 years group and the well-/moderately differentiated group. For patients with pulmonary metastasis, RAI improved the survival in the higher grade group but did not have a strong effect in the better grade group. Our data indicate that the disparity of metastatic sites has different risk factors. Similarly, this finding indicates that RAI should be precisely applied to patients who undergo DM but are young and have well-/moderately differentiated tumors and may improve survival in pulmonary metastasis patients with poor grade tumors."
0,Imaging Cherenkov emission for quality assurance of high-dose-rate brachytherapy,32108157,2020/02/27,"With advances in high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy, the importance of quality assurance (QA) is increasing to ensure safe delivery of the treatment by measuring dose distribution and positioning the source with much closer intervals for highly active sources. However, conventional QA is time-consuming, involving the use of several different measurement tools. Here, we developed simple QA method for HDR brachytherapy based on the imaging of Cherenkov emission and evaluated its performance. Light emission from pure water irradiated by an <sup>192</sup>Ir γ-ray source was captured using a charge-coupled device camera. Monte Carlo calculations showed that the observed light was primarily Cherenkov emissions produced by Compton-scattered electrons from the γ-rays. The uncorrected Cherenkov light distribution, which was 5% on average except near the source (within 7 mm from the centre), agreed with the dose distribution calculated using the treatment planning system. The accuracy was attributed to isotropic radiation and short-range Compton electrons. The source positional interval, as measured from the light images, was comparable to the expected intervals, yielding spatial resolution similar to that permitted by conventional film measurements. The method should be highly suitable for quick and easy QA investigations of HDR brachytherapy as it allows simultaneous measurements of dose distribution, source strength, and source position using a single image."
0,Occurrence of bisphenol A and its alternatives in paired urine and indoor dust from Chinese university students: Implications for human exposure,32069736,2020/5/01,"Bisphenol analogs (BPs), as the industrial chemicals, are widely used in consumer products. Limited information exists regarding human exposure to BPs in university students in China. In this study, we detected concentrations of seven BPs, namely bisphenol A (BPA), bisphenol AF (BPAF), bisphenol P (BPP), bisphenol AP (BPAP), bisphenol Z (BPZ), bisphenol S (BPS), and bisphenol F (BPF), in paired urine (n = 160) and indoor dust samples (n = 40) from university students in South China. High detection rates and levels (median) was found in BPA in paired urine (99%, 3.57 ng/mL) and indoor dust (80%, 2.98 μg/g) samples, followed by BPS (88%, 0.24 ng/mL; 78%, 0.22 μg/g). These findings suggest that BPA remains the major BPs used in consumer products. A positive relationship between urinary ∑BPs (sum of six BPs) concentration and indoor dust was observed (r = 0.444, p &lt; 0.01), indicated that exposure to non-dietary BPs may also be significant to human exposure. The median EDI<sub>urine</sub> values (ng/kg bw/day) of ∑BPs in males (119.6) were relatively higher than (p &lt; 0.05) those in females (84.6). By contrast, the median EDI<sub>dust</sub> of BPs (except for BPAF) in dust form female dormitories were slightly higher than that in dust from male dormitories. Notably, BPF was the most ingested from indoor dust (dormitory dust). This study is the first time to document the occurrence of BPs in paired urine and indoor dust in university students from China."
0,"A multiple genomic data fused SF2 prediction model, signature identification, and gene regulatory network inference for personalized radiotherapy",32329416,2020/01/01,"Radiotherapy is one of the most important cancer treatments, but its response varies greatly among individual patients. Therefore, the prediction of radiosensitivity, identification of potential signature genes, and inference of their regulatory networks are important for clinical and oncological reasons. Here, we proposed a novel multiple genomic fused partial least squares deep regression method to simultaneously analyze multi-genomic data. Using 60 National Cancer Institute cell lines as examples, we aimed to identify signature genes by optimizing the radiosensitivity prediction model and uncovering regulatory relationships. A total of 113 signature genes were selected from more than 20,000 genes. The root mean square error of the model was only 0.0025, which was much lower than previously published results, suggesting that our method can predict radiosensitivity with the highest accuracy. Additionally, our regulatory network analysis identified 24 highly important 'hub' genes. The data analysis workflow we propose provides a unified and computational framework to harness the full potential of large-scale integrated cancer genomic data for integrative signature discovery. Furthermore, the regression model, signature genes, and their regulatory network should provide a reliable quantitative reference for optimizing personalized treatment options, and may aid our understanding of cancer progress mechanisms."

We investigated the inter-BH reproducibility of the tumor position in expiratory BH using our proposed vector volume histogram (VVH) method. Subjects comprising 14 patients with lung cancer who were treated with lung SBRT under expiratory BH conditions were monitored by the Abches system. Multiple computed tomography (CT) scans were performed to evaluate the inter-BH reproducibility of the tumor position at the expiratory BH in the simulation session. Gross tumor volume was delineated by a physician. Deformable image registration was used to deform the images from the 3 expiratory BH-CTs to the treatment planning expiratory BH-CT. To evaluate the inter-BH reproducibility of the tumor positions, we measured the largest motion extent within the organ of 3 dimensions (left-right, LR; anterior-posterior, AP; cranio-caudal, CC) and a 3D vector using the VVH method. The average and standard deviations of the inter-BH reproducibility of the tumor position in the LR, AP, and CC directions, and the 3D vector were 1.7 ± 0.5, 2.0 ± 0.7, 2.1 ± 0.7, and 2.7 ± 0.7 mm, respectively. Ten patients exhibited inter-BH displacements of the lung tumor &gt;3 mm in the 3D vector. No displacement &gt;5 mm was observed in any direction for all patients. Our study indicated that the inter-BH variation of the tumor position was small for lung cancer patients, using the Abches system and the VVH method."
0,Role of Complex Networks for Integrating Medical Images and Radiomic Features of Intracranial Ependymoma Patients in Response to Proton Radiotherapy,32010703,2020/01/17,"Human cancers exhibit phenotypic diversity that medical imaging can precisely and non-invasively detect. Multiple factors underlying innovations and progresses in the medical imaging field exert diagnostic and therapeutic impacts. The emerging field of radiomics has shown unprecedented ability to use imaging information in guiding clinical decisions. To achieve clinical assessment that exploits radiomic knowledge sources, integration between diverse data types is required. A current gap is the accuracy with which radiomics aligns with clinical endpoints. We propose a novel methodological approach that synergizes data volumes (images), tissue-contextualized information breadth, and network-driven resolution depth. Following the Precision Medicine paradigm, disease monitoring and prognostic assessment are tackled at the individual level by examining medical images acquired from two patients affected by intracranial ependymoma (with and without relapse). The challenge of spatially characterizing intratumor heterogeneity is tackled by a network approach that presents two main advantages: (a) Increased detection in the image domain power from high spatial resolution, (b) Superior accuracy in generating hypotheses underlying clinical decisions."
0,Ex-Vivo Treatment of Tumor Tissue Slices as a Predictive Preclinical Method to Evaluate Targeted Therapies for Patients with Renal Carcinoma,31963500,2020/01/17,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the third type of urologic cancer. At time of diagnosis, 30% of cases are metastatic with no effect of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Current targeted therapies lead to a high rate of relapse and resistance after a short-term response. Thus, a major hurdle in the development and use of new treatments for ccRCC is the lack of good pre-clinical models that can accurately predict the efficacy of new drugs and allow the stratification of patients into the correct treatment regime. Here, we describe different 3D cultures models of ccRCC, emphasizing the feasibility and the advantage of ex-vivo treatment of fresh, surgically resected human tumor slice cultures of ccRCC as a robust preclinical model for identifying patient response to specific therapeutics. Moreover, this model based on precision-cut tissue slices enables histopathology measurements as tumor architecture is retained, including the spatial relationship between the tumor and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and the stromal components. Our data suggest that acute treatment of tumor tissue slices could represent a benchmark of further exploration as a companion diagnostic tool in ccRCC treatment and a model to develop new therapeutic drugs."

The planar DUP (pDUP) manifesting on a field edge was generated from the segmental aperture shape with a Gaussian folding on the beam's-eye view. The DUP at each voxel ( <math><mi>u</mi></math> ) was calculated by projecting the pDUP on the Delta4 phantom with its attenuation considered.

0,In vivo bioluminescence tomography-guided radiation research platform for pancreatic cancer: an initial study using subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic tumor models,33223595,2020/2/01,"Genetically engineered mouse model(GEMM) that develops pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma(PDAC) offers an experimental system to advance our understanding of radiotherapy(RT) for pancreatic cancer. Cone beam CT(CBCT)-guided small animal radiation research platform(SARRP) has been developed to mimic the RT used for human. However, we recognized that CBCT is inadequate to localize the PDAC growing in low image contrast environment. We innovated bioluminescence tomography(BLT) to guide SARRP irradiation for in vivo PDAC. Before working on the complex PDAC-GEMM, we first validated our BLT target localization using subcutaneous and orthotopic pancreatic tumor models. Our BLT process involves the animal transport between the BLT system and SARRP. We inserted a titanium wire into the orthotopic tumor as the fiducial marker to track the tumor location and to validate the BLT reconstruction accuracy. Our data shows that with careful animal handling, minimum disturbance for target position was introduced during our BLT imaging procedure(&lt;0.5mm). However, from longitudinal 2D bioluminescence image(BLI) study, the day-to-day location variation for an abdominal tumor can be significant. We also showed that the 2D BLI in single projection setting cannot accurately capture the abdominal tumor location. It renders that 3D BLT with multiple-projection is needed to quantify the tumor volume and location for precise radiation research. Our initial results show the BLT can retrieve the location at 2mm accuracy for both tumor models, and the tumor volume can be delineated within 25% accuracy. The study for the subcutaneous and orthotopic models will provide us valuable knowledge for BLT-guided PDAC-GEMM radiation research."

0,[Improvement of Nonuniformity on Flatbed Scanner for Radiochromic Film Dosimetry Using Average Correction Factor with Multi-direction Scan Data],32307365,2020/01/01,"In order to correct the lateral effect caused by the light source of the flatbed scanner in the Gafchromic film EBT3, the usefulness of the correction method using the average value of the correction coefficient considering the scan directions were evaluated. EBT3 was scanned from four directions to measure the optical density (OD) of the red, blue, and, red/blue components and the correction coefficient were calculated. For the correction coefficients, average values were calculated for the purpose of use, when the scan directions could not be aligned (average lateral effect correction). Correction accuracy was verified with the pass rate of gamma analysis (3 mm/3%, threshold 30%) of the dose distribution using the EBT3 film irradiated with the step pattern. OD of the red, blue, and, red/blue components in the scanning vertical direction tended to be higher in the center than in the peripheral portion. The pass rate of the step pattern was the red component's before correction, from 26.9 to 45.1% (before correction), from 84.1 to 96.7% (after correction), the red/blue component, from 37.6 to 48.4% (before correction) and from 84.4 to 96.7% (after correction). When using the correction coefficient using the average value, the pass rate was 89.8% for the red component and 94.7% for the red/blue component. The lateral effect correction improves the accuracy of the dose distribution verification, and the correction coefficient using the average value is useful when the scanning direction is different from that at the time of obtaining the dose concentration curve."
0,EGFRvIII upregulates DNA mismatch repair resulting in increased temozolomide sensitivity of MGMT promoter methylated glioblastoma,32066879,2020/4/01,"The oncogene epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) is frequently expressed in glioblastomas (GBM) but its impact on therapy response is still under controversial debate. Here we wanted to test if EGFRvIII influences the sensitivity towards the alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed the survival of 336 GBM patients, demonstrating that under standard treatment, which includes TMZ, EGFRvIII expression is associated with prolonged survival, but only in patients with O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylated tumors. Using isogenic GBM cell lines with endogenous EGFRvIII expression we could demonstrate that EGFRvIII increases TMZ sensitivity and results in enhanced numbers of DNA double-strand breaks and a pronounced S/G2-phase arrest after TMZ treatment. We observed a higher expression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins in EGFRvIII+ cells and patient tumor samples, which was most pronounced for MSH2 and MSH6. EGFRvIII-specific knockdown reduced MMR protein expression thereby increasing TMZ resistance. Subsequent functional kinome profiling revealed an increased activation of p38- and ERK1/2-dependent signaling in EGFRvIII expressing cells, which regulates MMR protein expression downstream of EGFRvIII. In summary, our results demonstrate that the oncoprotein EGFRvIII sensitizes a fraction of GBM to current standard of care treatment through the upregulation of DNA MMR."

Nodular melanoma is the second melanoma subtype in order of frequency. The prognosis of skin melanoma depends on the vertical growth of the tumor (Breslow index). For this measurement, excisional biopsy is strongly recommended. This is, however, an invasive procedure and may cause damage to the lymphatic drainage system. The HFUS system, , can be extremely useful for determining tumor thickness in the preoperative phase, given its high resolution capacity. The aim of this preliminary study is to define the role of HFUS for the nodular skin melanoma Breslow thickness in adults before surgery by making a comparison with histological features.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>In this study, 14 melanocytic lesions (8 male and 6 female) were evaluated with dermatoscopic clinical features strongly indicative of nodular melanoma. Out of these, excisional biopsy of 7 lesions was requested. The ultrasounds were performed preoperatively. The images were acquired through the first ultrasound scanner with ultra-high frequency probes (range from 50MHz to 70 MHz) available on the market under the EEC mark (Vevo ""MD, FUJIFILM Visual Sonics, Amsterdam, the Netherlands) equipped with a linear probe of 50-70 MHz.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>From the ultrasonographic analysis of 14 nodular melanoma thickness was determined for the presence of two hyperechogenic laminae, separated by a hypo / anechoic space. The twelve lesions were in situ while the other two lesions showed ultrasonography for example; the satellite lesions (less than two centimeters from the primary lesion) and in transit (localizable to more than two centimeters from the primary lesion). Four of these lesions were ulcerated. A comparsion was made the 7 lesions on between the thickness calculated with this method, and that obtained on the bioptic piece. The presence of a positive concordance has been evident in all of the cases.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>If further studies are needed to support its widespread clinical use, its is believed that, in expert hands and with an interdisciplinary team, HFUS is already capable to reliably calculate a Breslow index in a large majority of patients with cutaneous melanoma.</p>"

0,Long non‑coding RNA GAS5 increases the radiosensitivity of A549 cells through interaction with the miR‑21/PTEN/Akt axis,32020207,2020/3/01,"Radioresistance hinders the therapeutic outcomes of radiotherapy in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to participate in the regulation of multiple cell behaviors, whether they can modulate the radiosensitivity of NSCLC and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been well investigated. In the present study, it was revealed that NSCLC NCI‑H460 cells were more sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR) than A549 cells. Using the RNA‑Seq method, four highly differentially expressed lncRNAs were identified, including the growth arrest‑specific transcript 5 (GAS5), syntaxin binding protein 5 antisense RNA 1 (STXBP5‑AS1), metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) and X‑inactive specific transcript (XIST), which were predicted to play roles in the acquisition of radiosensitivity. Using real‑time quantitative PCR (qPCR), it was demonstrated that lncRNA GAS5 was significantly upregulated in NCI‑H460 cells but not in A549 cells during IR. Mechanistically, it was demonstrated that overexpression of lncRNA GAS5 decreased the level of microRNA‑21 (miR‑21). Overexpression of lncRNA GAS5 or suppression of miR‑21 markedly increased the IR‑induced cell apoptosis of A549 cells. It was also demonstrated that overexpression of lncRNA GAS5 increased PTEN expression and suppressed Akt phosphorylation through the modulation of miR‑21. Notably, it was revealed that IR enhanced the interaction between lncRNA GAS5 and the miR‑21/PTEN/Akt axis. In summary, the present findings revealed that lncRNA GAS5 has a radiosensitization effect on NSCLC, indicating the potential application of lncRNA GAS5 in NSCLC radiotherapy."
